				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Comoving frame calculations have been used to compute the spectral lines formed in rapidly expanding spherical media. We have employed the angle-averaged partial frequency redistribution function ùëÖ<sub>I</sub> with a two-level atom model in non-LTE atom approximation. A linear velocity law increasing with radius has been employed with maximum velocity at œÑ=0 being set equal to 30 mean thermal units. It is found that one obtains almost symmetric emission line profiles at large velocities similar to those found in quasars.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral lines formed in a rotating and expanding atmosphere have been computed in the frame of the observer at infinity. Two kinds of velocity laws are employed: (i) a uniform radial velocity of the gas and (ii) velocity increasing with radius (<i>i.e.</i> velocity gradients). The atmosphere has been assumed to be rotating with constant velocity. We have considered maximum radial and rotational velocities to be 10 and 3 mean thermal units respectively in an atmosphere whose geometrical thickness is 10 times the stellar radius. The total radial optical depth at line centre is taken to be about 100. In all cases, Doppler profile and a source function which is varying as 1/ùëü<sup>2</sup> have been used</p>
					<p>Generally, the lines are broadened when rotation is introduced. However, when radial motion is also present, broadening becomes asymmetric and the red emission and blue absorption are enhanced.</p>

				<title>Type I Supernovae and Iron Nucleosynthesis in the Universe</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0013-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is argued that the iron nucleosynthesis rate in the universe due to SNI outbursts is dependent on the mass function of star formation. Since the mass function depends on the chemical composition and since the masses of SNI precursors have upper limits, the iron nucleosynthesis rate was low at an earlier evolutionary epoch of the universe when mainly massive stars were formed. The iron nucleosynthesis rate should reach a maximum near ùëß ‚àº 0.5. At such or similar value of ùëß the well-known ‚Äòstep‚Äô in the cosmic ùõæ-ray background spectrum may be explained by the presence of ùõæ-gray quanta accompanying the radioactive <sup>56</sup>Co ‚Üí <sup>56</sup>Fe decay. An argument is presented against the identification of the hidden mass of the universe with black-hole remnants of ‚Äòtype III‚Äô stars.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The chatterton Astronomy Department aims to apply interferometers with very high resolving power to optical astronomy. The programme of the stellar intensity interferometer at Narrabri Observatory was completed in 1972 ans since then the work has been directed towards building a more sensityve instrument with higher resolving power. As a first step a much larger intensity interferometer was designed but was not built because it was large, expensive and not as sensituve as desired. Efforts as now being made to design a more sensituve and cheaper instrument. A version of Michelson's stellar interferometer is being built using modern techniques. It is hoped that it will reach stars of magnitude +8 and will work reliably in the presence of atmospheric scintillation. It is expected to cost considerably less than an intensity interferometer of comparable performance. The polot model of this new instrument is almost complete and should be ready for test in 1984.</p>

				<title>Distribution of Quasars on the Sky</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0031-0041</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown that high-redshift quasars of bright apparent magnitude are concentrated in the direction of the centre of the Local Group of galaxies. A number of them are distributed along a line originating from the Local Group companion galaxy, Œú 33. A similar, but shorter and fainter line of quasars is seen emanating from the spiral galaxy NGC 300 in the next nearest, Sculptor Group of galaxies. The concentration of bright quasars in the Local Group direction is supported by bright radio sources catalogued in high-frequency surveys. One of the consequences of this large-scale inhomogeneity is to explain the different gradient of radio source counts in the direction of the Local Supercluster, a result discovered in 1978 but never investigated further. Previously reported homogeneity and isotropy of radio-source counts over  the sky would seem to be an effect of integrating nearby, large-scale groupings with more distant, smaller-scale groupings over different directions in the sky. More careful analyses as a function of flux strength and spectral index on various scales over the sky are now required. Previous conclusions about radio source and quasar luminosity and number evolution drawn from log ùëÅ‚Äìlog ùëÜ counts would then need to be re-evaluated.</p>

				<title>The Radio Spectra of Galactic Centre Features</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0043-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The radio source Sgr A and neighbouring features have been mapped at a frequency of 843 MHz with a beamwidth of 43 $\times$ 87 arcsec. Comparisons have been made with published maps of comparable resolution at different frequencies in order to differentiate thermal and nonthermal regions. The arc feature to the north of Sgr A appears to consist of low temperature ionized hydrogen and to extend partly over Sgr A itself causing patchy absoprption at low frequencies; there is some evidence that the hydrogen in the arc has been expelled from the galactic nucleus. Previous suggestions that Sgr A East is a supernova remnant have been examined and the interpretation is found to be quite likely, but not compelling. The diffuse component of Sgr A West appears to be due entirely to ionized hydrogen surrounding the nucleus.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Radiation from the Magellanic Clouds is discussed from the point of view of near future possibilities in observational ùõæ-ray astronomy. The ùõæ-ray fluxes expected according to the metagalactic and galactic theories of the origin of cosmic rays are compared. It is shown that the strongest test of the metagalactic hypothesis will be provided by a determination of the ratio of ùõæ-ray fluxes from SMC and LMC. The ùõæ-ray luminosity of a typical young supernova remnant that can generate sufficient antiprotons is estimated. It is shown that such remnants must have a short phase during which they are very powerful ùõæ-ray emitters.</p>

					<p>The potential of high-resolution spatial interferometry for detailed mapping and precision astrometry in the mid-infrared region, somewhat analogous to interferometry now done in the microwave region, is discussed from an instrumental point of view. Some results from a prototype system and from tests of atmospheric properties are given. The design of a more advanced two-telescope system now under construction is outlined. This involves movable telescopes of 1.65m aperture and of high precision, using heterodyne detection of infrared in the 10 ùúám atmospheric window.</p>

				<page>0139-0148</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 4-km synthesis radio telescope has recently been commissioned at Ootacamund, India for operation at 327 MHz. It consists of the Ooty Radio Telescope (530m $\times$ 30m) and 7 small antennas which are distributed over an area of about 4km $\times$ 2km. It has a coverage of about ¬± 40¬∞ in declination ùõø. The beam-width is about 40 arcsec √ó 90 arcsec at ùõø = 0¬∞ and about 40 arcsec √ó 50 arcsec at ùõø = 40¬∞. The sensitivity attained for a 5:1 signal-to-noise ratio is about 15 m Jy after a 10-hour integration.</p>
					<p>The observational programmes undertaken and some of the results obtained recently are summarized. The radio halo around the edge-on spiral NGC 4631 is found to have a larger scale-height at 327 MHz than is known at higher frequencies. Mapping of interesting radio galaxies at 327 MHz is being carried out; preliminary results for 0511‚Äì305 (‚àº2 Mpc) and 1333‚Äì337 (‚àº750 kpc) are summarized. The very-steep-spectrum radio source in the Abell cluster A85 is found to be resolved; since it has no obvious optical counterpart, it is conceivable that it is a remnant of past activity of a galaxy that has drifted away in about 10<sup>9</sup> years.</p>

					<p>Photoelectric observations of the RS CVn type non-eclipsing binary UX Arietis obtained at Nizamiah Observatory during the observing seasons of 1975‚Äì76, 1981‚Äì82 and 1982‚Äì83 are presented. The light curve of UX Ari showed a distortion wave with an amplitude in ùëâ varying from 0.02 mag during 1975‚Äì76 to 0.15 mag during 1982‚Äì83. An analysis of the available data shows that the light maximum is almost constant. It is also evident that the light-curve minimum decreases as the wave amplitude increases. The constant light at maximum, ùëâ = 6.51 ¬± 0.03 indicates the unspotted photospheric brightness. It is also suggested that the variation in mean V brightness is mainly due to spot activity and not due to intrinsic variation.</p>

				<title>Millisecond Pulsars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0187-0207</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In 1982 we discovered a pulsar with the phenomenal rotation rate of 642 Hz, 20 times faster than the spin rate of the Crab pulsar. The absence of supernova debris in the vicinity of the pulsar at any wavelength indicates an age of the neutron star greater than 10<sup>5</sup> yr. The miniscule spindown rate of $1.1 \times 10^{-19}$ confirms the old age and indicates a surface magnetic field of 10<sup>9</sup> G. A second millisecond pulsar was discovered by Boriakoff, Buccheri &amp; Fauci (1983) in a 120-day orbit. These fast pulsars may have been spun-up by mass transfer in a close binary evolutionary stage. Arrival-time observations of the 642-Hz pulsar display remarkably low residuals over the first 14 months. The stability implied by these observations, $3 \times 10^{-14}$, suggests that millisecond pulsars will provide the most accurate basis for terrestrial dynamical time. If so, the pulsar data will lead to improvements in the planetary ephemeris and to new searches for light-year scale gravitational waves. Many new searches for fast pulsars are under way since previous sky surveys excluded pulsars with spins above 60 Hz.</p>

				<title>Models for the Formation of Binary and Millisecond Radio Pulsars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0209-0233</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The peculiar combination of a relatively short pulse period and a relatively weak surface dipole magnetic field strength of binary radio pulsars finds a consistent explanation in terms of (i) decay of the surface dipole component of neutron-star magnetic fields on a timescale of $(2‚Äì5) \times 10^{6}$ yr, in combination with (ii) spin-up of the rotation of the neutron star during a subsequent mass-transfer phase.</p>
					<p>The four known binary radio pulsars appear to fall into two different categories. Two of them, PSR 0655 + 64 and PSR 1913 + 16, have short orbital periods (&lt; 25 h) and high mass functions, indicating companion masses $0.7 M_\odot ( \sim 1 (\pm 0.3) Œú_\odot$ and $1.4 M_\odot$, respectively). The other two,  PSR $08 \geq 20 + 02$ and PSR 1953 + 29, have long orbital periods ( 117d), nearly circular orbits, and low, almost identical mass functions of about $3 \times 10^{-3} Œú_\odot$, suggesting companion masses of about $0.3 M_\odot$. It is pointed  out that these two classes of systems are expected to be formed by the later  evolution of binaries consisting of a neutron star and a normal companion star, in which the companion was (considerably) more massive than the neutron star, or less massive than the neutron star, respectively. In the first case the companion of the neutron star in the final system will be a massive white dwarf, in a circular orbit, or a neutron star in an eccentric orbit. In the second case the final companion to the neutron star will be a low-mass $(\sim 0.3 M_\odot)$ helium white dwarf in a wide and nearly circular orbit. </p>
					<p>In systems of the second type the neutron star was most probably formed by the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf. This explains in a natural way why PSR 1953 + 29 has a millisecond rotation period and PSR 0820 + 02 has not.</p>
					<p>Amoung the binary models proposed for the formation of the 1.5-millisecond pulsar, the only ones that appear to be viable are those in which the companion disappeared by coalescence with the neutron star. In such models the companion may have been a red dwarf of mass $0.03 M_\odot$, a neutron star, or a massive $(> 0.7 M_\odot)$ white dwarf. Only $\leq$ in the lastmentioned case is a position of the pulsar close to the galactic plane a natural consequence. In the first-mentioned case the progenitor system most probably was a cataclysmic-variable binary in which the white dwarf collapsed by accretion.</p>

				<title>Gravitational Lensing by Stars in a Galaxy Halo: Theory of Combined Weak and Strong Scattering</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0235-0250</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The theory of gravitational lensing of background quasars by stars in the halo of a galaxy is considered. In the limiting case of small ‚Äòoptical depth‚Äô, only one star is close enough to the beam to cause strong scattering, and the effect of all the other stars is treated as a perturbation with both systematic and random components. The perturbation coming from weak scattering can increase the number of images and the amplification in those cases where the amplification is already high; such events are preferentially selected in flux limited observations. The theory is applicable to the apparent association of background quasars with foreground galaxies. A comparison with earlier work on the same problem is given. The relevance of these results to gravitational lensing by galaxies as perturbed by random inhomogeneities surrounding the ray path is also briefly discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the stability of finite gaseous discs, against largescale perturbations, under the influence of spherical, massive haloes. A Surfacedensity distribution consistene with the observed spiral-tracer porfiles in disc galaxies is considered for the disc. We find that growing eigenmodes with both `trailing' and `leading' spirals exist in `cold' discs for a wide range of values of the halo mass and its radius. The amplification rates of the unstable modes reduce as the ratio of the mass of the halo to the mass of the disc is increased. A uniform halo is not very effective towards stabilizing the disc against these modes. The results from the present study are considered vis-a-vis previous studies on the global modes of self-gravitating discs.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Observations and analyses of two similar eruptive prominences on the north-east limb observed on 1980 April 27 at 0231 and 0517 UT, which are associated with the Boulder active region No. 2416 are presented. Both the eruptive prominences gave rise to white-light coronal transients as observed by C/P experiment of High Altitude Observatory on the Solar Maximum Mission. Type II and moving type IV radio bursts are reported in association with the first Hùõº eruptive prominence at 0231 UT.</p>
					<p>Both the Hùõº eruptive prominences showed pulse activity with a quasiperiodicity of about 2-4 min. We estimate a magnetic field in the eruptive prominence of abount 100 G and a build-up rate $\sim 10^{26}$ ergs<sup>-1</sup>. The high build-up rate indicates that the shearing of the photospheric magnetic field, which fed the energy into the filament, was rapid, was rapid. It is proposed that fast moving Hùõº , type II and coronal-transient observations, we estimate a magnetic field of 2.8G at $1.9R_\odot$ from the disc centre, which agrees well with the earlier results.</p>

An Einstein-de-Sitter `flat' universe with $\Omega =1$ which is appealing for throretical reasons -  can only be reconciled with the data if the galaxies are more `clumped' then the overall mass distribution, and are poor tracers of the unseen mass even on scales of several Mpc.

				<title>Arrival-Time Analysis for a Millisecond Pulsar</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0369-0388</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Arrival times from a fast, quiet pulasr can be used to obtain accurate determinations of pulsar parameters. In the case of the millisecond pulsar, PSR 1937 + 214, the remarkably small rms residual to the timing fit indicates that precise measurements of position, proper motion and perhaps even trigonometric parallax will be possible (Backer 1984). The variances in these parameters, however, will depend strongly on the nature of the underlying noise spectrum. We demonstrate that for very red spectra <i>i.e.,</i> those dominated those dominated by low-frequency noise, the uncertainties can be larger than the present estimates (based on a white-noise model) and can even grow with the observation period. The possibility of imporved parameter estimation through prewhitening' the data and the application of these results to other pulsar observations are briefly discussed. The post-fit rms residual of PSR 1937 + 214 may be used to limit the energy density of a gravitational radiation background at periods of a few months to years. However, fitting the pulsar position and pulse-emission times filters out significant amounts of residual power, especially for observation periods of less than three years. Consequently the present upper bound on the energy density of gravitational waves $\Omega_g \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-4} R^2_{\mu S}$, though already more stringent than any other available, is not as restrictive as had been previously estimated. The present limit is insufficient to exclude scenarios which use primordial cosmic strings for galaxy formation, but should improve rapidly with time.</p>

				<title>Binary Progenitors of Supernovae</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0389-0402</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Supernovae of both Type I (hydrogen-poor) and Type II (hydrogen-rich) can be expected to occur among binary stars. Among massive stars $(\gtrsim 10 Œú_\odot)$, the companion makes it more difficult for the primary to develop an unstable core of $\gtrsim 1.4 .M_\odot$ while still retaining the extended, hydrogen-rich envelope needed to make a typical Type II light curve. Among  $1‚Äì10 M_\odot$ stars, on the other hand, a companion plays a vital role in currently popular models for Type I events, by transferring material to the primary after it has become a stable white dwarf, and so driving it to conditions where either core collapse or explosive nuclear burning will occur. Several difficulties (involving nucleosynthesis, numbers and lifetimes of progenitors, the mass-transfer mechanism, etc.) still exist in these models. Some of them are overcome by a recent, promising scenario in which the secondary also evolves to a degenerate configuration, and the two white dwarfs spiral together to produce a hydrogen-free explosion, long after single stars of the same initial masses have ceased to be capable of fireworks.</p>

				<title>On the Supernova Remnants Produced by Pulsars</title>

				<page>0403-0423</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We conclude that pulsar-driven supernova remnants (SNRs) are extremely rare objects. Indeed an analysis of the known sample of plerions suggests a very low birthrate ‚àº1 in 240 years. Long-lived and bright plerions like the Crab nebula are likely to be produced only when the pulsar has an initial period ~10‚Äì20 milliseconds and a field ~10<sup>12</sup>G. Such pulsars inside rapidly expanding shell remnants should also produce detectable plerions. The extreme rarity of SNRs with such hybrid morphology leads us to conclude that these pulsars must have been born with an initial period larger than ~35‚Äì70 milliseconds.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present total-intensity and linear-polarization observations made with the VLA at 5 GHz of 1400+ 162, a BL Lac object in a group of galaxies. It has a misaligned triple structure with a prominent radio jet towards the east. There is evidence of a weak counter-jet towards the western component, which also has the more prominent warm-spot.</p>
					<p>We discuss possible explanations for some of the observed features of this source. Although interaction with the cluster medium is possibly partly responsible for the observed distortion, we suggest that the large observed misalignment could also be due to amplification of a smaller misalignment by projection effects. In the relativistic beaming model, where BL Lac objects arise when the relativistic jets are seen end-on, we suggest that 1400+ 162 is more oblique to the line of sight than most members of this class. </p>

				<title>Short-Term Intrinsic-Intensity Variations of Pulsars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0483-0493</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pulsars show intensity variations over timescales ranging from a few microseconds to a few years. Short-term intensity variations, i.e. those having timescales of a few minutes to a few hours had been difficult to study as their timescales are similar to those due to interstellar scintillations.</p>
					<p>We present here a method to separate the autocorrelation function of the short-term broadband intensity variations from that of the interstellar scintillations and thus overcome the above difficulty. The method assumes that the intrinsic variations are correlated over a bandwidth much larger than the decorrelation bandwidth for scintillations. Hence the ratio of the power in the variations due to the two causes depends on the bandwidth used. By applying the method to the intensity variations of 24 pulsars, we show that the presence of short-term intrinsic variations is very common in the radiation of pulsars. Quasi-periodicities were detected in the intensity variations of many pulsars, but their origin is not clear.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Over the past fifteen years, observations of some quasars with the techniques of very-long-baseline interferometry have shown that the angular separation between pairs of radio-emitting regions in their cores is increasing year after year. If the quasars are indeed as far away as implied by Hubble‚Äôs law, then these angular motions translate into linear speeds several times the speed of light. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to show that the observed motions are illusory. The leading contender in this field‚Äîthe relativistic beam model‚Äîand an alternative offered by the concept of a gravitational screen are described and compared in the light of recent observational data. </p>

				<page>0005-0019</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tidal interactions in binary stellar systems are studied under the assumption that the orbital motion of the binary is negligible in comparison with the stellar motion. By integrating over time the tidal forces acting on the stars, the energy changes are derived. These are used to obtain simple analytical expressions for the rates of disruption and merging. This method gives appropriate value for the Roche density ùúåR and it is found that the disruption rate of a satellite of density ùúå changes drastically at $\rho \simeq \rho R$ A comparison is made with earlier results obtained under the simplifying assumption that stellar motion is negligible in comparison with the orbital motion of the binary and its implications are discussed. </p>

				<page>0021-0034</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Inclusion of radiative heat transport in the energy equation for a slender flux tube leads to oscillations of the tube. The amplitude of the oscillations depends on the radius of the tube when lateral heat exchange alone is considered. Longitudinal heat transport has a greater influence on the evolution of the instability than lateral heat exchange for the particular value of tube radius considered in the calculation. Heat transport is seen to reduce the efficiency of concentration of magnetic fields by convective collapse in the case of polytropic tubes.</p>

				<title>Interstellar Scintillation Measurements of Pulsars at 326.5 MHz</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0035-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have measured the decorrelation frequency $(f_v)$ and decorrelation time $(t_v)$ for 15 pulsars. We show by combining our data with those of others that $f_v \varpropto DM^{- 1.79 \pm 0.14}$ and $t_v \varpropto DM^{-0.80 \pm 0.15}$ up to a dispersion measure (DM) of about 60 cm<sup>-3</sup> pc. The combined data set does not form a complete sample, but the relations obtained from our measurements on 14 pulsar, which form almost a complete sample up to 41 cm<sup>-3</sup> pc, are consistent with the above relations, suggesting that these relations are not seriously affected by selection effects. The relations are broadly in agreement with those expected from a homogeneous interstellar medium and are in disagreement with earlier conclusions by others that these relations steepen even for low-DM pulsars. The agreement suggests that the local interstellar medium is homogeneous at least up to a distance of about 2 kpc.</p>

				<title>An X-ray Hubble Diagram for Quasi-stellar Objects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0056</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>To form the Hubble diagram for quasi-stellar objects (QSOs),we have made use of the recently published data on X-ray fluxes of 159 QSOs observed from the Einstein Observatory. The scatter in the Hubble diagram and the lack of an obvious redshift-flux density correlation for these QSOs have been attributed to the observational selection effect that the intrinsically less luminous QSOs can be detected only in the nearby region of space. When the optical, radio and X-ray selection effects are removed, keeping only the intrinsically brighter sources, we obtain a sample of 16 QSOs having a small dispersion in X-ray luminosities (‚å© log Lx ‚å™ = 46.12 ¬± 0.28), a statistically significant linear correlation between (log f<sub>x</sub>, log ùëêùëß) pairs and a slope A = ‚Äì1.906 ¬± 0.061 of the linear regression of log f<sub>x</sub> on log ùëêùëß. This slope is consistent, at a confidence level of 95 per cent or greater, with the slope of ‚Äì2.0 expected theoretically based on the assumption that the redshifts of QSOs are cosmological in nature.</p>

				<page>0085-0100</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied in detail the energetics of Kerr‚ÄìNewman black hole by the Penrose process using charged particles. It turns out that the presence of electromagnetic field offers very favourable conditions for energy extraction by allowing for a region with enlarged negative energy states much beyond ùëü = 2M, and higher negative values for energy. However, when uncharged particles are involved, the efficiency of the process (defined as the gain in energy/input energy) gets reduced by the presence of charge on the black hole in comparison with the maximum efficiency limit of 20.7 per cent for the Kerr black hole. This fact is overwhelmingly compensated when charged particles are involved as there exists virtually no upper bound on the  efficiency. A specific example of over 100 per cent efficiency is given.</p>

					<p>The absolute magnitude ùëÄ<sub>ùë£</sub> of the hydrogen deficient binary œÖ Sgr has been estimated as ‚Äì4.8 ¬± 1.0 from the distribution of the interstellar reddening, polarization and interstellar lines of the surrounding stars. From the ANS observations obtained at the time of the secondary eclipse, it appears that the hotter secondary is surrounded by a disc with colours of a B8‚ÄìB9 star. The ùúÜ 1550 CIv absorption line arising in the stellar wind does not show any change in strength during the secondary minimum. The upper limit to the mass-loss rate from the high temperature wind is estimated as $5 \times 10^{‚Äì7} M_\odot yr^{‚Äì1}$ from the 2 cm and 6 cm radio observations.</p>

				<title>Yields of Nucleosynthesis from Massive and Intermediate Mass Stars and Constraints on their Final Evolution</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0113-0130</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Nucleosynthetic yields and production rates of helium and heavy elements are derived using new initial mass functions which take into account the recent revisions in Œü star counts and the stellar models of Maeder (1981a, b) which incorporate the effects of massloss on evolution. The current production rates are significantly higher than the earlier results due to Chiosi &amp; Caimmi (1979) and Chiosi (1979), and a near-uniform birthrate operating over the history of the galactic disc explains the currently observed abundances. However, the yields are incompatibly high, and to obtain agreement it is necessary to assume that stars above a certain mass do not explode but proceed to total collapse. Further confirmation of this idea comes from the consideration of the specific yields and production rates of oxygen, carbon and iron and the constraints imposed by the observational enrichment history in the disc as discussed by Twarog &amp; Wheeler (1982). Substantial amounts of <sup>4</sup>He and <sup>12</sup>C, amongst the primary synthesis species, are contributed by the intermediate mass stars in their wind phases. If substantial numbers of them exploded as Type I SN, their contribution to the yields of <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>56</sup>Fe would be far in excess of the requirements of galactic nucleosynthesis. Either efficient massloss precludes such catastrophic ends for these stars, or the current stellar models are sufficiently in error to leave room for substantial revisions in the specific yields. The proposed upward revision of the <sup>12</sup>C (ùõº, ùõæ) <sup>16</sup>O rate may produce the necessary changes in stellar yields to provide a solution to this problem. Stars that produce most of the metals in the Galaxy are the same ones that contribute most to the observed supernova rate.</p>

One of the radio sources shows evidence for a shell structure with a size of ~ 15 pc, confirming the SNR nature of this source.

				<title>On a Nonlinear and Lorentz-Invariant Version of Newtonian Gravitation‚ÄîII</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0171-0175</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper gives a full nonlinear version of Newtonian gravity in which the gravitational energy acts as a source of the gravitational field. The generalized field equation for the scalar gravitational potential is solved for a spherically symmetric localized distribution of matter. It is shown that the perihelia of orbits of test particles in such a field precess steadily. The effect is, however, too small to account for the observed shift in the perihelion of planet Mercury. Further, the bending of light in this theory is zero. It is suggested that these inadequacies of the quasi-Newtonian framework call for more sophisticated approaches to gravity.</p>

				<title>A Survey of Recombination Line Emission from the Galactic Plane at 325 MHz</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0177-0201</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A survey of the H 272ùõº recombination line at 325 MHz has been made towards 53 directions in the galactic plane using the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). 34 of these directions correspond to well-known HII regions, 12 tp SNRs and 6 to `blank' areas selected so that the 5 GHz continuum is a minimum over the telescope beam of $2^\circ \times 6$ arcmin. Observing procedure and spectra of 47 sources towards which lines are dected are presented. Hydrogen recombination lines have been detected towards all the observed directions having ùëô &lt; $40^\circ$. Carbon recombination lines are identified in 12 of the directions. The hydrogen line intensities are found to correlate well with the total continuum intensity (which includes the nonthermal galactic background) indicating that most of the lines arise due to stimulated emission by the background radiation. A preliminary discussion on the nature of the line-emitting regions is also presented.</p>

				<title>Low Density Ionized Gas in the Inner Galaxy‚ÄîInterpretation of Recombination Line Observations at 325 MHz</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0226</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The recent survey of H 272ùõº recombination line (324.99 MHz) in the direction of 34 HII regions, 12 SNRs and 6 regions of continuum minimum (‚Äòblank‚Äô regions) in the galactic plane is used to derive the properties of diffuse ionized gas in the inner Galaxy.</p>
					<p>The intensity of radio recombination lines at high frequencies is dominated by spontaeous emission in high-density gas and that at low frequencies (325 MHz) by stimulated emission in low-density gas. We have used this property to obtain the electron density in the gas in the direction of blank regions and SNRs, by combining the H 272ùõº measurements (preceeding paper) with the published data at higher frequencies. Further, we have imposed constraints on the electron temperature and pathlength through this gas using the observed high-frequency continuum emission, average interstellar electron density and geometry of the line-emitting regions. The derived properties of the gas are (i) electron density 0.5-6 cm<sup>-3</sup>, (ii) electron temperature 3000-8000 K and (iiI) emission measures 500-3000 pc cm<sup>-6</sup>. The corresponging pathlengths are 50-200pc. </p>
					<p>As the derived sizes of the low-density regions are small compared to the pathlength through the Galaxy, the low-frequency recombination lines cannot be considered as coming from a widely distributed component of the interstellar medium</p>
					<p>The HII regions studied in the above survey cannot themselves produce the H 272ùõº lines detected towards them because of pressure broadening, optical depth, and beam dilution. However, the agreement in velocity of these lines with those seen at higher frequencies suggests that the low-frequency recombination lines arise in low-density envelopes of the HII regions. Assuming that the temperature of the envelopes are similar to those of the cores and invoking geometrical considerations we find that these envelopes should have electron densities in the range 1‚Äì10 cm<sup>-3</sup> and linear sizes of 30‚Äì300 pc in order to produce the observed H 272ùõº lines.</p>

					<p>The effect of a perturbing mass on a homogeneous collisionless cloud of dark matter is considered in the linear approximation. It is shown that gravitational potential can have turning points, in sharp contrast with gravitating systems of finite extent. The model offers a reasonable explanation for the observed secondary maxima in the density distribution of rich clusters. The relevance of the model to the flatness of the rotation curves of galaxies is also discussed.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0261-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We argue that observations on Milky Way and dwarf spheroidals imply existence of individual haloes around dwarf spheroidals. If neutrinos (or any other ‚Äòhot‚Äô particle) provide the dark matter then we show that: (i) Embedding of visible matter inside large (‚àº few Mpc) dark matter islands is observationally untenable. (ii) Dwarf spheroidals possess dark matter haloes of about 10 kpc radius around them, and have an (ùëÄ/ùêø) ratio of about 10<sup>4</sup> (iii) The haloes of spiral galaxies (ùëí.ùëî. Milky Way) extend to about 100 kpc in radius. If ‚Äòcold‚Äô dark matter makes up the haloes, then no significant constraints are obtained. We discuss briefly the effect of these constraints on larger scales.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>If the dwarf spheroidals are embedded in an extended cloud of dark matter then their density profiles can be reproduced by assuming a Maxwellian distribution of velocities for the constituent stars. The observed luminosity profiles of dwarf spheroidals imply densities for the dark matter in the range 10<sup>-26</sup> to 10<sup>-25</sup> g cm<sup>-3</sup>, and mass-to-luminosity ratios which are typically an order of magnitude greater than those of globular clusters. Neutrinos of mass ‚àº 10 eV and $\langle v \rangle \sim 1000$ km s<sup>-1</sup> can provide this requisite density for the background.</p>

					<p>Extensive and meticulous observations of the rotation curves of galaxies show that they are either flat or gently going up, but rarely decreasing, at large galactocentric distances. Here we show that the gravitational potential which would lead to such rotation curves arises naturally when the visible matter modelled as a collisionless Maxwellian gas is embedded in a dark halo of collisionless particles with a much higher dispersion in velocities.</p>

				<title>Dark Matter‚ÄîSystematics of its Distribution</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0029-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The dynamical masses of dwarf-spheroidals, spiral and elliptical galaxies, dwarf irregular binaries, groups of galaxies and clusters are shown to lie in a band about the $M \sim \rho R^3$ line. The value of $\rho$ is approximately the same as that estimated for unseen matter in the solar neighbourhood. The clusters themselves lie about the $M \sim R^{-3}$ line derived for a self-gravitating neutrino gas; their masses are distributed around the maximum Jeans-mass, $M_{\text{Jmax}.}$ corresponding to $m_v \simeq 10$ eV in an expanding universe. The presentday length scales of clusters and the dispersion in the velocities observed within them are understood in terms of a 100-fold expansion subsequent to the initial growth of the fluctuations at $M_{\text{Jmax}.}$ These systematics on the ùëÖ-ùëÄ plane imply that the initial condensations in the expanding universe are on the scale of the rich clusters of galaxies, these condensations were triggered dominantly by the gravitation of the neutrinos and the constant density of all systems arises naturally due to the embedding of these systems in the large scale neutrino condensations. If the neutrino density falls of as ùëü<sup>-2</sup> beyond the cluster edge till the distributions from different clusters oberlap, then the mean density of the neutrinos approximately equals the closure density of the universe.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The massive and active galaxies in the core of the Virgo Cluster were shown in 1968 to be aligned on either side of Œú 87, along the direction of the jet and counter-jet. Recent observations confirm the significance of this alignment by showing that the brightest X-ray sources, including additional large galaxies, define the same line.</p>
					<p>Detailed X-ray maps of Œú 86 show that this galaxy, which is part of the alignment, is probably blown by a wind from Œú 87 due to its close alignment with the jet. But the large radio Œï galaxy, Œú 84, which is 1.4 degrees away from Œú 87, and <i>exactly</i> along the line of the jet, is shown by the compression of its X-ray isophotes to be actually moving out along the line of the jet. This evidence furnishes rather spectacular support for the earlier conclusion that Œú 84 had originated as a proto-galaxy within Œú 87 and had been ejected out along the line of the jet.</p>

					<p>Places of formation have been derived for a sample of 23 Cepheids with well-determined atmospheric abundances in an attempt to study the chemical inhomogeneities in the local interstellar medium. The abundance data available for the sample Cepheids is compiled and critically reviewed to adopt the most reliable esimates. We find that the most conspicuous irregularity in the metallicity is exhibited by stars that are born in the local arm or in the interarm region. We propose a scenario to explain these local variations in terms of supernova-induced star formation in interstellar gas enriched by massive stars formed in the density wave.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown that the luminosity-volume test for optically selected objects has an in-built bias towards increasing the average value of ùëâ/ùëâ<sub>m</sub> above the Euclidean value of 1/2. A more satisfactory bias-free statistic is suggested in the form of In (ùëâ/ùëâ<sub>m</sub>), The result of applying the test to a sample from the Bright Quasar Survey (BQS) shows that the local hypothesis of quasars is consistent with the data.</p>

				<page>0113-0118</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Coordinates of polar faculae have been measured and processed using daily photoheliograms of the Kislovodsk Station of the Pulkovo observatory with the final goal of studying their latitude distribution during the solar cycles 20‚Äì21. The results obtained are as follows:</p>
					<p>1. The first polar faculae emerge immediately after the polarity inversion of the solar magnetic field at the latitudes from 40¬∞ to 70¬∞ with t he average $\varphi \simeq 55^\circ$.</p>
					<p>2. The zone of the emergence of polar faculae migrates poleward during the period between the neighbouring polarity inversions of the solar magnetic field. This migration is about 20¬∞ for 8 years, which corresponds to a velocity of 0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
					<p>3. The maximum number of polar faculae was reached at the activity minimum (1975‚Äì1976).</p>
					<p>The last polar faculae were observed in the second half of 1978 at the latitudes from 70¬∞ to 80¬∞. </p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0119-0129</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present VLA Œë-array observations at ùúÜ20, 6 and 2 cm and B-array observations at ùúÜ20 and 6 cm of the quasar B2 1320 + 299, which has a very unusual radio structure. In addition to a component, A, coincident with the quasar, there are two lobes of radio emission, Œí and C, on the same side of A. These are located at distances of $\simeq$ 25 and 50 arcsec respectively from A. The present observations show that A has a flat-spectrum component coincident with the quasar and a weak outer component at a distance of $\simeq$ 4 arcsec along PA $\simeq$ 100¬∞. The morphology of Œí resembles a head-tail type of structure with its tail towards the north-east. The magnetic field lines in component Œí appear to follow the bend in the tail. Component C exhibits some extension towards the north-west. We discuss the possible nature of B2 1320 + 299 and suggest that while A appears to be an independent source, the relation between Œí and C, if they are associated at all, is unclear. Deep optical observations are essential to help clarify the situation.</p>

				<page>0131-0139</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radio recombination lines are known to be observable at positions along the galactic ridge which are free of discrete continuum sources. Based on the results of a recent survey of H272ùõº lines it is shown that most of the observed galactic ridge recombination lines can be explained as emission from outer low-density envelopes of normal HII regions. The distribution of low-density ionized gas and discrete HII regions as a function of the distance from the galactic centre is also derived.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Observations of the H272ùõº recombination line towards the galactic centre show features near ùëâ<sup>LSR</sup>= 0, ‚Äì50 and + 36 kms<sup>-1</sup>. We have combined the parameters of these features with the available Œó166ùõº measurements to obtain the properties of the ionized gas present along the line of sight and also in the ‚Äò3 kpc arm‚Äô. For the line-of-sight ionized gas we get an electron density around 7 cm<sup>-3</sup> and a pathlength through it ~ 10‚Äì60 pc. The emission measure and the electron temperature are in the range 500‚Äì2900 pc cm<sup>-6</sup> and 2000‚Äì6000 Œö respectively. The ionized gas in the 3 kpc arm has an electron density of 30 cm<sup>-3</sup> and extends over 9 pc along the line of sight if we assume an electron temperature of 10<sup>4</sup> K.</p>
					<p>Using the available upper limit to the intensity of the H351ùõº recombination line, we show that the distributed ionized gas responsible for the dispersion of pulsar signals should have a temperature &gt; 4500 Œö and a minimum filling factor of 20 per cent. We also show that recombination lines from the ‚Äòwarm ionized‚Äô gas proposed by McKee &amp; Ostriker (1977) should be detectable in the frequency range 100‚Äì150 MHz towards the galactic centre with the sensitivity available at present.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0155-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a detailed study of the inhomogeneous Stephani-Krasi≈Ñski solution with time-dependent curvature index. In general, the cosmological behaviour of the models depends on six arbitrary functions of time. Such models are termed ‚Äòprivate universes‚Äô and cannot be in accord with observation in the most general case. Two simple models with changing topology are considered as illustrating examples. In one of these models the pressure turns out to be negative and hence a violation of the weak energy condition in the singularity theorems is possible. A brief review of other inhomogeneous cosmologies is included for the sake of clarity. It is shown that the geodesic equation can be reduced to a complicated differential equation, which depends on the three arbitrary functions involved. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain explicit formulas for the various observational relations.</p>

					<p>Spectrophotometric and spectroscopic observations of CQ Cep‚Äîthe shortest-period binary with WN component‚Äîare presented. Excepting the ŒùV ùúÜ4603, the fluxes of all other emission lines show enhancement at minima. They can be explained by the Roche surfaces that take into account the strong wind of the WN7 component. Various radial velocity curves for emission and absorption give different orbital solutions with a general positive shift of ùõæ axes. Although Œù IV ùúÜ4058 represents the true motion of the WN7 component, its flux variations are influenced by geometric effects. There is no signature of the companion. The extent of the atmosphere of CQ Cephei appears larger than in V444Cyg, another eclipsing binary with a Wolf-Rayet component.</p>

				<title>Composite Spectra Paper 1: HR 6902</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0195-0223</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Composite-spectrum binary stars generally consist of a late-type giant and a main-sequence star of type A or B. Their spectra are therefore rather confusing; but by a technique of digital subtraction of the spectra of appropriate single late-type giants, composite spectra can be split into their  individual components. In favourable cases the radial velocities of both  components can be measured and the mass ratio determined. The procedures are illustrated by reference to HR 6902, a fifth-magnitude composite spectrum binary. Its components are shown to have spectral types of G9 II and B8 V, with a mass ratio of 1.31, and its orbit is determined. There is some evidence that the system shows eclipses. If it does, the masses of the components are 3.9 and 3.0 $M_\odot$ respectively, and HR 6902 becomes the sixth known member of the important class of ùúÅ Aur binaries.</p>

					<p>New observations of the jet in 3C 273 support and refine our earlier interpretation that (i) the mapped jet is $10^{6\pm 0.3}$ yr old and grows at 0.6 to 0.75 times the speed of light, at an average angle ùúÉ of (20 ¬± 10)¬∞ with respect to the line of sight; (ii) its twin is not seen yet because arriving signals were emitted when it was some 10<sup>0.6 ¬± 0.2</sup> times younger; (iii) the fluid moving in the jet is an extremely relativistic e<sup>¬±</sup>-pair plasma, of bulk Lorentz factor $\gamma \gtrsim 10^2$; (iv) the beam has swung in projection through some 10¬∞; and (v) the small excursions (wiggles) of the jet around its average propagation direction result from a self-stabilizing interaction with the nonstatic ambient plasma. All other interpretations of which we are aware depend heavily on the (‚Äòbeaming‚Äô) assumption that the jet material radiates isotropically in some (comoving) Lorentz frame, an assumption which we consider unrealistic.</p>

					<p>The source IRAS 03134 + 5958 identified by Iyengar &amp; Verma (1984) on the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) prints with a nonstellar optical object with $[P ‚Äì R] \simeq 5.3 \pm  1.5$ is near the edge of Lynds dark cloud No. 1384 and is either embedded in or behind the cloud. The galactic latitude of this source (b<sup>II</sup> = 2¬∞3), its position vis-a-vis the Lynds dark cloud, its nonstellar appearance, high [ùëÉ ‚Äì ùëÖ] colour and its far-infrared spectrum, all suggest the possibility of its being a Herbig-Haro (HH) object. To test this possibility we undertook measurements of its proper motion and variability (two of the characteristic properties of HH objects). These yield $\mu \alpha = (3.6 \pm 2.3)$ arcsec/century and $\mu \delta = (-1.2 \pm 2.0)$ arcsec/century for its proper motion. The source reveals large variation in brightness between 1950 and 1954. Optical line studies of the source are required to confirm its classification as an HH object</p>

					<p>We present preliminary results of a spherical-harmonic-Fourier analysis of sunspot activity during the twenty-two years 1933‚Äì1954. The results indicate that the sunspot activity might be originating in global solar oscillations with periods of years and decades. However, except for the axisymmetric mode of degree 6, the set of other axisymmetric modes showing ~ 11 yr periodicities are different from one sunspot cycle to another. A more detailed analysis, preferably with larger data series, will be needed to arrive at a more definite conclusion.</p>

				<title>The 59 s Periodicity of 2CG 195 + 4 (Geminga) and a Low-Mass Binary Model</title>

				<page>0299-0304</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An examination of the existing period searches for 2CG195 + 4 leads to the conclusion that the 59 second periodicity is highly significant only for the 1981 March 17‚Äì18 detection of Bignami, Caraveo &amp; Paul (1984). The statistical significance is increased substantially if the pulsation period is half the previously reported value. The period derivative is not well determined. Here we propose that 2CG 195 + 4 is a neutron star powered by accretion from a low $(\lesssim 1M_\odot)$ mass main-sequence companion. A distance of a few hundred pc would imply that the neutron star is a fast rotator and is spinning down.</p>

				<title>A Spectrophotometric Study of the Wolf-Rayet Star HD 50896</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0305-0316</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>New spectrophotometric observations of the Wolf-Rayet system HD 50896 are presented and interpreted in terms of its binary nature. The lines of Œù V, Œù IV and C IV show moderate variations, which can be explained using a binary model with a compact companion. He II ùúÜ4686 appears to arise from a larger region compared to other lines. The distortion caused by the wind can partly explain its flux variations. The emission fluxes of He I lines are generally constant indicating their non-participation in the orbit. The results are compared with other Wolf-Rayet binaries (V444 Cyg and CQ Cep) and the evolutionary status is discussed.</p>

				<title>Stellar Orbits in Elliptical Galaxies with Relativistically Active Nuclei</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a model galaxy composed of a relativistically active nucleus, a main body, and a halo, all three components considered as homogeneous prolate ellipsoids, we explore the probable association of the internal characteristics of the nucleus and the observed orbits of the stars near the surface of the main body. Using the authors' theoretical framework of post-Newtonian general relativistic galactic dynamics, proposed earlier, we prove that a fast-ratating and possibly expanding or contracting nucleus affects the distribution of the box-type orbits near the surface of the main body resulting in a flattening of the main body. The nuclear rotation always results in a flattening, and the contraction contributes less to the flattening than the expansion. However, the contributions of a rotating and changing nucleus are not additive. The study of the post-Newtonian effects in the nucleus on the stellar orbits in the main body, and the consequent modifications of the corresponding non-relativistic results, could in principle provide useful information concerning the kinematical and dynamical characteristics of the nuclei of the elliptical galaxies. The explanation (of at least the post-Newtonian part) of the flattening of elliptical galaxies attempted here seems to be the first theoretical one proposed in the literature.</p>

				<title>ùëÅ-Body Simulations of Tidal Encounters between Stellar Systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0031</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>ùëÅ-Body simulations have been performed to study the tidal effects of a primary stellar system on a secondary stellar system of density close to the Roche density. Two hyperbolic, one parabolic and one elliptic encounters have been simulated. The changes in energy, angular momentum, mass distribution, and shape of the secondary system have been determined in each case. The inner region containing about 40 per cent of the mass was found to be practically unchanged and the mass exterior to the tidal radius was found to escape. The intermediate region showed tidal distension. The thickness of this region decreased as we went from hyperbolic encounters to the elliptic encounter keeping the distance of closest approach constant. The numerical results for the fractional change in energy have been compared with the predictions of the available analytic formulae and the usefulness and limitations of the formulae have been discussed.</p>

				<title>On the Interpretation of the Observed Angular-Size;Flux-Density Relation for Extragalactic Radio Sources</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0033-0050</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The interpretation of the observed relation between median angular sizes (ùúÉ<sub>ùëö</sub>) of extragalactic radio sources and flux density at 408 MHz has been examined. The predicted ùúÉ<sub>ùëö</sub>-ùëÜ relations based on well-observed strong sources in parent samples selected at 178 and 1400 MHz, and existing models of the evolving radio luminosity function can be made to fit the observed relation only by invoking cosmological evolution in linear sizes even for the ùëû<sub>o</sub> = 0 universe. Predictions based on a parent sample at 2.7 GHz are shown to overestimate the contribution of steep-spectrum, compact (SSC) sources in low-frequency samples unless the downward curvature in the spectra of such sources is taken into account. When approximate corrections are made for this effect, predictions based on the 2.7 GHz parent sample cannot obviate the need for linear size evolution as claimed in the literature.</p>

				<title>Very High Energy Gamma Rays from the Crab Pulsar</title>

				<page>0069-0078</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Ooty data on VHE (&gt; 600 GeV) ùõæ-rays from the Crab pulsar have been used to look at possible emission on three different timescales, <i>viz</i>. years, minutes and hours. When averaged over three years of observation, there is no significant time-averaged emission. But intersesting aspects are revealed when the data are subdivided into miniruns of one minute duration. Minutes with moderate ùõæ-ray activity were isolated with a ùúí<sup>2</sup> analysis. The summed phasogram of such minutes shows two strong peaks coinciding with the radio main pulse and the interpulse respectively. The probability that these are due to chance is small. The phasogram has a bimodal distribution which indicates some emission from the middle region between the two phases. In general, there is no significant emission on the timescale of a few hours. However, the main pulse, as well as the bimodal distribution, were seen also in the total data of two nights of simultaneous observation at two sites during 1984‚Äì1985.</p>

				<title>Nitrogen Enhancement in Metal-Poor Dwarfs: From Inside or Outside?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0093-0097</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The five known metal-poor dwarfs with an enhanced N/Fe ratio have been observed spectroscopically. Two of these dwarfs have no lithium line; the absence of lithium is most probably accounted for by the usual convective destruction. The three other dwarfs have the same lithium abundance as the normal metal-poor dwarfs (Spite, Maillard &amp; Spite 1984). This excludes the deep mixing process as the general source of nitrogen enhancement, since lithium is destroyed in deep (hot) layers. Deep mixing had been previously found unlikely in metal-poor dwarfs (Da Costa &amp; Demarque 1982). The discussion stresses the remarkable uniformity of the lithium abundance in metal-poor dwarfs, and shows that the N-rich contaminating matter has a high N/H ratio. Finally, the Al abundance is not greatly enhanced in these five stars.</p>

				<title>The Role of a Strong Far-Infrared Radiation Field in Line Excitation and Cooling of Photodissociation Regions and Molecular Clouds</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0169-0181</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have theoretically studied the influence of a far-infrared radiation (FIR) field from Œó<sub>II</sub> region on the cooling by C and Œü atoms, C<sup>+</sup> ion and CO molecule in a photodissociation region, and a molecular cloud associated with Œó<sub>II</sub> region (hereinafter referred as H<sub>I</sub> region) at low temperatures (ùëá<sub>k</sub> 200 K). Comparisons have been made for cooling with and without FIR for two extreme abundances (10<sup>-4</sup> and 10<sup>-7</sup>) of the mentioned species for temperatures ranging between 10 and 200K and an hydrogen particle density range 10 cm<sup>-3</sup> $\leq$ n<sub>o</sub> 10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
					<p>The cooling by the species with low line-splitting (C<sub></sub>I, C<sub>II</sub> and C<sub>O</sub>) is significantly influenced by the radiation field for temperatures ùëá<sub>k</sub> &lt; 100 Œö while the effect of radiation field on cooling by Œü<sub>I</sub> is significant even at higher temperatures (ùëá<sub>k</sub> &gt; 100 Œö). The effect of FIR field on the cooling of CO from low rotational transitions is negligibly small, whereas it is considerable for higher transitions. In general, the cooling terms related to the short-wavelength transitions are more affected by FIR than those related to longer wavelengths.</p>
					<p>It is also demonstrated here that in the determination of thermal structure of an Œó<sub>I</sub> region the dust grains play an important role in the heating of gas only through photoelectron emission following irradiation by far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, as the infrared radiation from the dust is too small to have substantial effect on the cooling. It is found that in the Œó<sub>II</sub>/H<sub>I</sub> interface the FIR field from grains in the Œó<sub>II</sub> region is not capable of modifying the temperature of the warmest regions but does so in the inner part where the temperature is low enough.</p>

				<title>Evolution of the Optical Spectrum of SN 1987a in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
				<feature>Articles</feature>
				<page>0195-0209</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The evolution of the spectrum of SN1987a is traced from 1987 February 26 to March 31. Based on the low-resolution spectroscopic data we identify the lines of H, He<sub>I</sub>, Na<sub>I</sub>, Fe<sub>II</sub>, Sc<sub>II</sub>, Ca<sub>II</sub> which are known to be present in Type II Supernovae, and also present evidence for the existence of lines of Mg<sub>I</sub>, Ca<sub>I</sub>, Œü<sub>I</sub>, and Œù<sub>I</sub>. We discuss the evolution of the Hùõº profile, and draw attention to its complex structure around March 30. Close to the rest wavelength of HŒ± a double-peaked structure appeared in the profile with a peak-to-peak separation of ~ 1400 km s<sup>-1</sup>, suggestive of an expanding shell or disc of gas.</p>
					<p>Using the available broadband photometric information, we also trace the evolution of the photosphere of SN1987a assuming that it radiates like a supergiant.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Based on maps of the extragalactic radio sources Cyg A, Her A, Cen A, 3C 277.3 and others, arguments are given that the twin-jets from the respective active galactic nucleus ram their channels repeatedly through thin, massive shells. The jets are thereby temporarily choked and blow radio bubbles. Warm shell matter in the cocoon shows up radio-dark through electron-scattering.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoelectric and photographic photometry of twenty-nine stars was done in the field of the open cluster Collinder 97 ‚â° OC1 506. Of these stars, a total of twenty-four have been found to be possible members. There is apparently no interstellar extinction in the direction of this cluster which is in the constellation of Monoceros: its ùê∏(ùêµ ‚Äì ùëâ) = 0.0 mag. This cluster is situated at a distance of 0.63 ¬± 0.01 kpc, which is well within the local arm of our Galaxy. The age of this cluster is in the range of $1 \times 10^8$ to $5.9 \times 10^8$ yr, which puts it in an older age group. Thus, it cannot be specifically considered as a spiral-arm tracer in the study of our Galaxy.</p>

				<title>3C 120 and the Surrounding Region of Sky</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0231-0239</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Image processing performed on a series of photographs of the superluminal Seyfert galaxy, 3C 120, shows the outer optical disc to consist of fragmented segments generally pointing toward the centre. One long arm of peculiar, separated knots comes off to the W and SW. A peculiar companion is seen along the line of the NW radio jet. In the interior, optical jets are detected which are aligned along the direction of the outer radio jets</p>
					<p>A region of the sky $45 \times 25$ degrees around 3C120 is investigated. It is found that:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>A nebulous filament about 3/4 degree in length points to 3C 120.</li>
						<li>Hydrogen clouds of redshift ùëß = ‚Äì 130 and ‚Äì 210 km s<sup>-1</sup> are situated at 3 and 1 degrees on either side of 3C 120.</li>
						<li>Eleven low-surface-brightness galaxies with 4500 &lt; ùëß &lt; 5300 km s<sup>-1</sup> fall within a radius of 8 degrees.</li>
						<li> Seven quasars with $z \gtrsim 1.35$ and radio fluxes $S_b \gtrsim 0.3$ fall within a radius of 10 degrees.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>It is concluded that the concentration of these objects in the vicinity of this unique, active galaxy has a negligible chance of being accidental and that all those objects of diverse redshift are at the same nearby distance. This smaller distance reduces the supposed superluminal motions in 3C 120 to quite precedented ejection velocities.</p>

				<title>Additional Members of the Local Group of Galaxies and Quantized Redshifts within the Two Nearest Groups</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0241-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Galaxies of redshift ùëß \lesssim 1000$ km s<sup>-1</sup> are investigated. In the South Galactic Hemisphere there are two large concentrations of these  galaxies. One is in the direction of the centre of the Local Group, roughly aligned with Œú 31 and Œú 33. The other concentration is centred almost 80 degrees away on the sky and involves the next nearest galaxies to the Local Group, NGC 55, NGC 300 and NGC 253.</p>
					<p>The large scale and isolation of these concentrations, and the continuity of their redshifts require that they are all galaxies at the same, relatively close distance of the brightest group members. The fainter members of the group have higher redshifts, mimicking to some extent a Hubble relation. But if they are all at the same average distance the higher redshifts must be due to a cause other than velocity.</p>
					<p>The redshifts of the galaxies in the central areas of these groups all obey a quantization interval of $\Delta cz_0 = 72.4$ kms<sup>-1</sup>. This is the same quantization found by William Tifft, and later by others, in all physical groups and pairs which have been tested. The quantization discovered here, however, extends over a larger interval in redshift than heretofore encountered.</p>
					<p>The majority of redshifts used in the present analysis are accurate to ¬± 8 km s<sup>-1</sup>. The deviation of those redshifts from multiples of 72.4 km s<sup>-1</sup> averages ¬± 8.2 km s<sup>-1</sup>. The astonishing result, however, is that for those redshifts which are known more accurately, the deviation from modulo 72.4 drops to a value between 3 and 4 km s<sup>-1</sup>! The amount of relative velocity allowed these galaxies is therefore implied to be less than this extremely small value.</p>

				<page>0257-0262</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent work on the violent relaxation of collisionless stellar systems has been based on the notion of a wide class of entropy functions. A theorem concerning entropy increase has been proved. We draw attention to some underlying assumptions that have been ignored in the applications of this theorem to stellar dynamical problems. Once these are taken into account, the use of this theorem is at best heuristic. We present a simple counter-example.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Evolution of energy and angular distributions of electrons has been studied by combining small-angle analytical treatment with large-angle Monte Carlo calculations as a function of column density for initially monoenergetic and monodirectional electrons. The incident electron energies considered are 20, 30 and 60 keV at 0¬∞, 30¬∞ and 60¬∞ angles of incidence. Using these distributions, time evolution of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum has been studied. The slopes of the curves calculated compare well with the experimentally observed curve.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Based on a simple picture of speckle phenomena in optical interferometry it is shown that the recent signal-to-noise ratio estimate for the so called bispectrum, due to Wirnitzer (1985), does not possess the right limit when photon statistics is unimportant. In this wave-limit, which is true for bright sources, his calculations over-estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for the bispectrum by a factor of the order of the square root of the number of speckles.</p>

				<title>Ionospheric Refraction Effects on Radio Interferometer Phase</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0281-0294</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The refraction of radio waves as they traverse through the terrestrial ionosphere and troposphere introduces a differential phase path which results for a radio interferometer in variations of the visibility phase. Though refraction due to troposphere is significant for synthesis radio telescopes operating at 1.0 GHz and above, ionospheric refraction is dominant at lower frequencies. This problem is important in the case of Ooty Synthesis Radio Telescope (OSRT) operating at 326.5 MHz, due to its proximity to the magnetic equator. This paper deals with the nature of phase variations suffered by OSRT due to refraction and explains the methodology evolved to alleviate them.</p>

				<page>0295-0303</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Hùõº observations of a flare-associated surge prominence on 1980 October 30 have been described. Morphology and dynamics of the surge prominence have been presented. From our observations and analysis we have estimated the magnetic field associated with surge material to be about 35 gauss which is in good agreement with the earlier result of Tandberg-Hanssen &amp; Malville (1974). It has been determined that coronal pressure is not acting as a resistive force on the outward expansion of the surge into the corona. The kinetic energy of the surge was about 10<sup>28</sup> erg, which is 2 orders less than required for the mass to escape the chromosphere. It appears that the flare-associated surge prominence was perhaps a result of kink instability in the flaring region.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0315-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present here, for the O and B type stars in the Catalogue of Stellar Ultraviolet Fluxes, an approach which does not require a precise knowledge of spectral type and luminosity class for deriving ùê∏(ùêµ-ùëâ) colour excesses. The method is based on the use of an UV-visual two-colour diagram; galactic variations in the interstellar extinction law are analyzed and fully taken into account. Our results have been compared with those derived by using the differences between observed and intrinsic colours for stars with known spectral classification. The very good agreement in a large number of cases (94 per cent) demonstrates that our approach permits the derivation of reliable colour excess values for early type stars even if only a rough spectral classification is available.</p>

				<title>On an Unharmonic Oscillator Potential for Elliptical Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0331-0341</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using a direct numerical procedure we approximate a `realistic' potential for an elliptical galaxy by that of a perturbed harmonic oscillator. The quality of fitting is checked using two criteria. First by computing the value of the fitting parameter ùëì, and second by comparing the behaviour of orbits for the two potentials. Both criteria suggest that the fitting is good when the total energy ‚Ñé is smaller than the energy of escape in the unharmonic potential.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A mixture of off-centred Gaussians is used to approximate the predicted monochromatic point spread functions (PSFs) of Hubble space telescope (HST) at long wavelengths, and also, with a reduced number of parameters, the wide-band PSFs. The usefulness of the approximation in simulation and analysis of HST data is shown by means of application to image centring and convolution-deconvolution problems.</p>

				<title>Experiments with CP Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0351-0367</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Described here is a preliminary and tentative application of a method for fine-classification of stars, selected for studies of galactic structure. The present investigation is based on about 100 stars within the approximate spectral type range B6‚ÄìA5, for which both spectra and UBV photometry have been obtained.</p>
					<p>The motivation of the project is the following: For the study of galactic fine-structure it is essential to use as many members as possible of stellar agglomerations of various type for a statistical treatment of the meterial. A-type stars are fairly numerous and reasonably bright, but if all chemically peculiar stars, fast rotators or multiple systems have to be omitted there is generally too little left for a relevant investigation. Here we perform some experiments in order to find a method for fine-classification of A stars, both normal and chemically peculiar, within the framework of the M K system.</p>
					<p>In this connection it is desirable to reduce the present multitude of CP classifications to a manageable number. It is shown here that, independenttly of the definition of the degree of peculiarity, there is no sharp borderline separating the CP stars from the `normal' ones.</p>
					<p>Also it is found that spectral classification can on an average be performed with almost the same accuracy for CP stars as for the ‚Äònormal‚Äô ones provided cases of extreme peculiarity are avoided.</p>

				<title>Spectroscopic Evolution of Nova LW Serpentis 1978 during its Early Decline</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0369-0387</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical spectroscopic data are presented on nova LW Serpentis 1978, obtained during its decline from ùëâ 9.0 to $\simeq$ 10.2 (compared to a value of ‚àº 8.0 at recorded maximum). The spectrum and its evolution compare well with a typical nova, though the principal absorption (‚àº - 750 km s<sup>-1</sup>) was very weak in comparison with the diffuse-enhanced absorption (‚àº -1300 km s<sup>-1</sup>). The principal absorption could be identified only in the lines of O I ùúÜùúÜ7774, 8446, and in moderate-resolution observations of Hùõº. The salient features of spectral evolution follow: The near-infrared triplet of Ca II continuously weakened O I ùúÜ8446 was always brighter than O I ùúÜ 7774, indicating continued importance of Lyman ùõΩ fluorescence. The lines due to [O, I], [N, II] and N II brightened considerably near the end of our observations (37 days from maximum). The Hùõº emission line was asymmetric all through with more emission towards the red. Its emission provile showed considerable structure. Based on the individual peaks in the Hùõº line profile, a kinematerial model is proposed for the shell of LW Ser. The model consists of an equatorial ring, and a polar cone on the side away from the earth. The nearer polar cone did not show significant emission of Hùõº during our observation. The polar axis of the shell is inclined at a small angle $(\sim 15^\circ)$ to the line of sight.</p>

					<p>In an endeavour to resolve reported discrepancies in the value of the branching ratio of <sup>176</sup>Lu at astrophysical energies, a new determineation of the <sup>175</sup>Lu (ùëõùõæ) <sup>176m</sup>Lu capture cross section has been measured as 958 ¬± 58 mb. This gives a value of the branching ratio of 0.21 ¬± 0.05. This result indicates that some reequilibration of the ground and isomeric states of <sup>176</sup>Lu occurs in stellar environments undergoing ùë†-process nucleosynthesis, and confirms that <sup>176</sup>Lu is not a reliable cosmochronometer. However the very existence of <sup>176</sup> in the solar system implies that the ground state of <sup>176</sup>Lu was not completely depopulated, and provides the possiblity of using this nuclide as a sensitive thermometer for stellar processes.</p>

				<title>CCD Star Images: On the Determination of Moffat‚Äôs PSF Shape Parameters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0024</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Among the variety of empirical models of optical Point Spread Function used in the astronomical environment, only the Moffat‚Äôs (1969) one is able to describe by means of two parameters (in the circular case) both the inner and the outer star image regions. In view of this very important feature, the problem of the simultaneous estimates of Moffat‚Äôs PSF shape parameters, off-centring, and the background level in CCD star images has been investigated. The problem does not seem to be rigorously resolvable, but an approximate way to calculate all the parameters except off-centring is shown. It must be stressed that, the Moffat‚Äôs PSF model being a softened power law belonging to the family of modified King and Hubble models, the present discussion can be of aid in many other research fields. Also, the integral equation enabling us to convolve a spherical source with Moffat‚Äôs PSF is given and applied for comparison to Multi-Gaussian convolution.</p>

				<title>Accretion Effects on Compact Members of Binary Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0025-0039</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We explore the change in the period of axial rotation and in the radius of a magnetized compact star in a binary system, induced by the accretion on it of mass with angular momentum from the surface of its non-compact companion. No specific assumption is made concerning the accretion model, and the primary‚Äôs interior is described by the Fermi-Dirac statistics for degenerate matter. The rate of change with time of the period and radius is expressed in terms of the compact primary‚Äôs physical parameters and total absolute luminosity. The conditions are fully derived under which the above changes can be positive, negative or even vanish. In the case of the millisecond pulsars in binary X-ray sources the predicted values of the period time derivative, depending on the values of the accretion rate and. the absolute luminosity, can be positive or negative‚Äîif not vanishing‚Äîand they fall absolutely in the range10<sup>-21</sup> ‚Äì10<sup>-17</sup> ss<sup>-1</sup>, in good agreement with current observational data. The corresponding rate of change of radius, either positive or negative, fall in the range of 10<sup>-3</sup> -<sup>-1</sup> cm y<sup>-1</sup>. Finally, it is proved that the wellknown bursters can be explained by thermonuclear flash due to gravitational instability in the accreted matter, but their explanation as a result of direct contraction could be possible only for quite high accretion rates $(10^{-7} M \odot y^{-1})$. This last result indicates that, in contrast to the accretion-induced change in period, which can be of either sign irrespective of the primary's age, the accretion-induced non-catastrophic contraction is impossible, while according to repent results the contraction in general is possible for yound compact objects.</p>

				<title>Evidence for Moving Features in the Corona from Emission Line Profiles Observed during Eclipses</title>

				<page>0041-0047</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the line profiles of [Fe x] 6374 √Ö and [Fe XIV] 5303 √Ö emission lines observed during five total solar eclipses, we address the problem whether the solar corona is static or contains moving features. Many of the profiles of both emission lines have complicated shapes, which we interpret as an evidence for the existence of many, small, moving features in the corona. The line-of-sight velocities observed by other investigators (<i>e.g.</i> Desai, Chandrasekhar &amp; Angreji 1982) also support this view. On the other hand, about 15 recent interferometric and multislit investigations of coronal emission lines have not shown evidence of moving elements. We suggest that this is due to insufficient spatial resolution.</p>

					<p>Recently Lau &amp; Prokhovnik (1986) have formulated a new scalar-tensor theory of gravitation which reconciles Dirac‚Äôs large numbers hypothesis with Einstein's theory of general relativity. The present work points out an error in the time-dependent cosmological term and the scalar potential given by Lau and Prokhovnik. The correct forms for these quantities are derived. Further, a vacuum Robertson‚ÄìWalker solution to the generalized field equations is obtained, under an anasatz that we ropose, which illustrates that the theory is, in some sense, incomplete.</p>

					<p>Samples of spiral galaxies from two catalogues of 21 cm line observations and a catalogue of near-infrared observations of nearby galaxies have been used in conjunction with Infrared Astronomical Satellite data to study correlations involving ùëÄ<sub>ùê∫</sub>, the dynamic mass of the galaxies, the luminosities in the ùêª band (1.6 ùúám), the blue band and the far infrared bands and the mass of atomic hydrogen, it is found that both the blue and the far-IR luminosities which are indicators of star formation averaged over $\sim 3 \times 10^9$  and $\sim 10^7$  years respectively, have a linear dependence on ùëÄ<sub>ùê∫</sub>. On the other hand, the Œó luminosity which is a measure of star formation averaged over the lifetime of galaxies, has a steeper power law dependence on ùëÄ<sub>ùê∫</sub>. The correlations observed do not have significant dependence on the morophological type of the galaxies There is a poor correlation between the far-infrared luminosity and the mass of atomic hydrogen. The mass of atomic hydrogen has a dependence of the form ùëÄ<sub>ùê∫</sub>. Because of the decrease in the mean mass for later morphological types and due to differences in power law dependences of luminosities in different bands on ùëÄ<sub>ùê∫</sub>, the mean value of luminosity-to-mass ratio is a constant for blue and far-IR bands, decreases for the ùêª band and the gas-to-mass ratio increases as morphological type increases.</p>

				<title>Spectroscopic Observations of SN1987a in the LMC</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0093-0106</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes the results of optical spectroscopy of SN1987a carried out at Mt John University Observatory on a regular basis since 1987 February 25. Typical spectra are presented in an evolutionary sequence, and velocities of Balmer and selected metallic lines are measured in either emission or absorption. The velocities are interpreted together with the results of photoelectric photometry. The Barnes-Evans relationship has been applied to the photometry to give an angular diameter of the photosphere. The expansion belocity of the photosphere is initially about 3700 km s<sup>-1</sup> which is similar to the asymptotic value from weaker absorption lines such as the MgIb line. After 40 days the photosphere appears to expand more slowly and it reaches a maximum size of about 145 A.U. after 100 days before receding inwards. The photometry and spectroscopy together result in a distance modulus of 18.3 ¬± 0.2.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Analysis of the available observational data for the ùõº-Persei cluster members shows that rotation effects on the intermediate-band indices c<sub>1</sub> and (ùë¢ ‚Äì ùëè) are considerable. In c<sub>1</sub>, rotation produces a reddening of 0.040 magnitudes per 100 km s<sup>-1</sup> In (ùë¢ ‚Äì ùëè) the effect for Œí stars is found to be 0.06 magnitudes per 100 km s<sup>-1</sup> of ùëâ sin ùëñ.</p>
					<p>The binaries and peculiar stars are found to behave differently in the colour excess (due to rotation) versus ùëâ sin ùëñ diagrams. These empirical effects can be utilised to recalibrate these colour indices and also to separate members that are either chemically peculiar or in binary systems.</p>

					<p>Kinematical distances are estimated for six open star clusters. They agree fairly well with the photometric distances.

				<abstract>
					<p>Solar Active Region NOAA 2372 was observed extensively by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite and several ground-based observatories during 1980 April 4‚Äì13 in the Solar Maximum Year. After its birth around April 4, it underwent a rapid growth and produced a reported 84 flares in the course of its disc passage. In this paper, we have studied photospheric and chromospheric observations of this active region together with Marshall Space Flight Center magnetograms and X-ray data from HXIS aboard the SMM satellite. In particular, we discuss the relationship of the flare-productivity with sunspot proper motions and emergence of new regions of magnetic flux in the active region from its birth to its disappearance at the W-limb</p>

HD 151932, a suspected variable, shows variations in the emission line flux as well as continuum magnitude measurements. An attempt is made to understand this variation as due to the asymmetric atmospheric structure.

					<p>We study the effects of the presence of vortex rings surrounding a supersonic radio jet inside the cocoon of a radio lobe. We show that both the jet and the shocked ambient medium are pinched. Flow speed inside the cocoon is always close to the sonic value and it stays so by successively passing through several oblique shocks. We also discuss the possibility of the non-linear growth of the instabilities of the contact surface to explain the numerical results in the literature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>HD 88021/2 (ADS 7662) is a very close visual binary. The accepted visual orbit, which is of very high eccentricity and graded ‚Äúreliable‚Äù, led to the expectation of a periastron passage in 1981, when there should have been a large difference in radial velocity between the components. No such event took place, and there is little indication that it is likely to occur in the near future. A new interpretation of the visual orbital data leads to an orbit of a different character from those hitherto proposed. A decision between the competing orbits should be possible within a very few years. Meanwhile, the method of spectral subtraction developed in Paper 1 has enabled us to separate the spectra of the two components and to show that their spectral types are K0 III and A2m.</p>

					<p>HD 115781 and HD 116204 (BL CVn and BM CVn) are shown to be RS CVn binaries with periods near 20 days. HD 115781 is doublelined; the primary type is about K1 III, while the secondary is probably a late-type subgiant. The masses of the two components are equal within observational error. These is substantial photometric variability with a period half the orbital period; it is attributed to ellipsoidal variation. HD 116204 is also of type K1 III. It shows exceptionally strong Ca II H and K emission, together with an emission-line spectrum typical of RS CVn stars in the <i>IUE</i> ultraviolet region, but Hùõº is an absorption line. The secondary star in the HD 116204 system has not been detected. The primary shows photometric variations, presumably due to starspots, with a period 5 per cent longer than the orbital period.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0231-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The occurrence of superluminal motion in extragalactic radio sources is believed to be quite common. Among others, the geometrical scattering of radio radiation can also cause superluminal expansion and or motion and halo formation. In this paper, the effectiveness of the stimulated Raman scattering in producing these features is investigated. The scattering medium is a plasma whose position, density and temperature decide the rate and angle of scattering. When the radiation from a stationary and constant source gets scattered from a stationary plasma, a halo is formed around the source. However, the scattering of a rotating radiation beam does produce superluminal motion of the virtual source. It is found that the plasma should have the characteristics of the emission-line regions and the intercloud medium in order to Raman scatter the radiation. Since the scattering is polarization dependent, it is possible to estimate the rotation of the electric vector along the direction of the apparent motion of a radio source.</p>

					<p>We study numerically the motion of a single particle in the bending wave of finite thickness in Saturn‚Äôs ring. We include the forcing due to the planet, a moon, the coriolis force and the self gravity of the ring. In particular, we compute the variation of the velocity arising due to the variation of the amplitude and the phase of the epicyclic motion across the local vertical height of the ring. We suggest that the dissipation of energy due to the collision of ring particles in this shear layer damps out the bending wave of Saturn‚Äôs ring at the 5:3 vertical resonance of Mimas within a distance of 150 km from the site of its launching as is observed in Voyager data.</p>

					<p>During the recent apparition of Comet Halley in 1985‚Äì86 a transient ionic event in the form of a blob of H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup> emission was recorded in thecoma at ~ 0<sup>‚Ñé</sup> UT on 1986 March 13. Observations were carried out using a special IHW filter for H<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup> emission at 7000 √Ö/175 √Ö, a 35 cm telescope, a Fabry‚ÄìPerot interferometer and an image intensifier camera from Gurushikhar, Mt Abu. (24¬∞39‚ÄôN, 72¬∞47‚ÄôE). A Fabry‚ÄìPerot interferogram in HŒ± taken a few minutes later at the same location reveals strong hydrogen emission (Hùõº) associated with the blob. The velocity field in the blob is structured with relative velocities upto ~ 35km s<sup>-1</sup>. The event is interpreted as arising due to the sector boundary crossing of the interplanetary magnetic field by the comet.</p>

					<p>Starting from a set of general equations governing the dynamics of a magneto-fluid around a compact object on curved space time, a fairly simple analytical solution for atest disc having only azimuthal component of velocity has been obtained. The electromagnetic field associated has a modified dipole configuration which admits a reasonable pressure profile for the case of fully relativistic treatment of Keplerian type of velocity distribution.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Differential ùêµùëâ photometry of UX Ari obtained on 58 nights during 1984‚Äì85, 1985‚Äì86, 1986‚Äì87, and 1987‚Äì88 observing season is presented. We find that (ùêµ-ùëâ) is phase dependent with the system being reddest at the light maximum and we interpret this as due to the variable fractional contribution by the G5 V component to the total light at shorter wavelengths. An analysis of the available data indicates that at larger amplitudes of the photometric wave the brightness at maximum increases and that at minimum decreases and both converge to $\Delta V \simeq 1.0$ mag at very low amplitudes. It implies that the low wave amplitudes are essentially due to more homogeneity in the surface distribution of spots rather than due to low levels of spot activity. The variation in wave amplitude is found to be near-sinusoidal with a period around 13‚Äì14 years.</p>

					<p>Results of a search for occulatations of stars in the SAO catalogue by Saturn's outer magnetosphere during 1989-1990 are presented. A total of nine events are predicted to occur during this period. The most favourable event will be the occultation of 28 Sgr (SAO 187255) during July 2-3, 1989. Occultations of SAO 187036, SAO 188348 and SAO 188120 occur near opposition and therefore can be observed over a wide longitude range.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A theory of sequential fragmentation is presented that describes a cascade of fragmentation and refragmentation, <i>i.e.,</i> continued comminution. It is shown that the theory reproduces one of the two major empirical descriptors that have traditionally been used to describe the mass distributions from fragmentation experiments. Additional experimental evidence is presented to further validate the theory, and includes explosive aerosolization, grinding in a ball mill, and simulated volcanic action. Also presented are some astronomical applications of the theory including infalling extraterrestrial material, siderophile concentrations in black magnetic spherules of possible meteoritic origin, the asteroids, the distribution of galactic masses, and the initial mass function of stars.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoelectric photometry has been obtained for CF Octantis on 39 nights. The object is a member of the RS CVn class and has a highly active chromosphere. A 20.15 ¬± 0.06 d period has been found from the ùêµ and ùëâ  magnitudes, which is interpreted as the rotational modulation of the light from a non-uniformly spotted star. The amplitude of this spot wave is observed to vary slowly between $\Delta$ ùëâ about 0<sup>m</sup>.1 and 0<sup>m</sup>.3, which may be evidence for an activity cycle of 9 ¬± 3 years.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Relative level populations for Œü III, derived using electron impact excitation rates calculated with the R-matrix code, are used to deduce the electron-temperature-sensitive emission-line ratio $R=I(2s^2 2p^2 {}^1D-2s^2 2p^2 {}^1S) /I (2s^2 2p^2 {}^3P_{1, 2} - 2s^2 2p^2 {}^1D) = I (4363 √Ö)/I (4959+ 5007 √Ö)$ for a range of ùëáùëí = (7500‚Äì20000 K) applicable to planetary nebulae. Electron temperatures deduced from the observed values of ùëÖ in several planetary nebulae are in excellent agreement with those determined from ùëáùëí-sensitive line ratios in other species, including C III]/C II, [ŒùII] and [Ar III], which provides support for the accuracy of the atomic data adopted in the level population calculations.</p>

The estimated bond energies are in reasonably good agreement with the values in the literature.

				<page>0161-0172</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>High resolution (11.7 to 64 arcsec) multifrequency radio observations of DA 495 (G 65.7 + 1.2) at 20, 49 and 92cm wavelengths with the VLA, WSRT and OSRT are presented. A map of infrared emission in the surrounding region is also presented. Although the remnant has a minimum near the centre, its brightness distribution does not shw limb brightening. Hence it has characteristics of both shell-type SNRs and Crab-type SNR. Alternatively it has an unusually thick shell with inner and outer radii of 125 and 500 arcsec respectively. The volume emissivity within the shell decreases radially outward. Its integrated flux density spectrum is characteristic of a shell-type remnant. The role of the reverse shock in the formation of a thick shell is discussed. The association of the open star cluster NGC6834 withDA 495 is also noted. The parameters of twenty nine small diameter sources detected around DA 495 are also presented. The radio source 1949+291 is associated with an IRAS source. 1948+292 may be a Crablike pulsar-driven synchrotron nebula. The radio spectrum of the planetary nebula NGC 6842 is optically thick at 49cm.</p>

					<p>Mass segregation in the form of preferential concentration of more massive stars in the central regions of a number of open star clusters has been known for some time. In this paper, integrated ùëàùêµùëâ colours in concentric zones have been estimated for 12 nearby open clusters using the observations of individual cluster members. It is found that the clusters showing pronounced mass segregation also show significant radial variations in the integrated colours. However, the effects of stochastic fluctuations around the massive portion of the mass distribytion function on the integrated colours should be taken into consideration, if they are present.</p>

					<p>This study is part of an investigation of the possibility of using chemically peculiar (CP) stars to map local galactic structure. Correct luminosities of these stars are therefore crucial. CP stars are generally regarded as main-sequence or near-main-sequence objects. However, some CP stars have been classified as giants.</p>
					<p>A selection of stars, classified in literature as CP giants, are compared to normal stars in the same effective temperature interval and to ordinary ‚Äònon giant‚Äô CP stars. We find no clear confirmation of a higher luminosity for ‚ÄòCP giants‚Äô, than for CP stars in general. In addition, CP characteristics seem to be individual properties not repeated in a component star or other cluster members.</p>

In particular we find the frequency of the oscillation near the elliptic points, the ratio of the semiaxes of the ellipses surrounding them and the inclination angle of the asymptotes of the hyperbolic orbits in the original variables ùë• ‚Äì ùëù<sub>ùë•</sub>. The results are in satisfactory agreement with those given by numerical integration of the equations of motion. Some possible applications for the motion of stars in elliptical galaxies are also discussed.</p>

				<title>Extragalactic Sources with very Asymmetric Radio Structure: VLA and MERLIN Observations</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0203-0235</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>As part of our study to understand the nature of extragalactic radio sources which are very asymmetric in the surface brightness of the two lobes, often with radio emission on only one side of the nucleus, we have observed a large number of them with high angular resolution and good surface brightness sensitivity at radio frequencies. In this paper we present VLA and MERLIN observations of 15 such sources. We discuss their observed structures and spectra, and possible explanations for their morphologies. We report evidence of a possible correlation between the hot-spot brightness ratio and the degree of core prominence, used as a Statistical measure of source orientation, suggesting that relativistic beaming of the hot-spot emission does play a significant role in the observed brightness asymmetry. To explain the apparently one-sided sources within the relativistic beaming framework, the velocities required are in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 ùëê. We discuss the possibility that the lobe which is seen to the south of the jet in 3C273 is the counter-lobe seen in projection. We also draw-attention to a number of one-sided sources with very weak cores, and discuss their possible nature.</p>

				<title>The 1985 Outburst of RS Ophiuchi: Spectroscopic Results</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0237-0255</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Optical spectroscopic data on the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi obtained between 32 and 108 days after its last outburst on 1985 January 27 are presented. RS Oph was in the coronal-line phase at that time. The widths of the permitted as well as coronal-lines decreased continuously. Assuming that the ejected envelope decelerated due to its interaction with circum stellar matter, its size is deduced as a function of time. Observed fluxes in permitted lines would then imply that the electron density decreased from $3 \times 10^9$  cm<sup>-3</sup> on day 32 to $1.8 \times 10^8$ cm<sup>-3</sup> on day 108, for an assumed filling factor of 0.01. The helium abundance in the ejecta is estimated to be ùëõ(He)/ùëõ(H) ~ 0.16. The mass of the unshocked ejecta was $3 \times 10_{-6} (\phi/0.01)^{1/2} M_{\odot}$, (at this stage, where f is the filling factor. Observed fluxes in coronal-lines imply that the temperature of coronal-line region decreased from $1.5 \times 10^6$ Œö on day 32 to $1.1 \times 10^6$ Œö on day 108. Most of the coronal line emission, as well as He II emission arises in shocked and cooling ejecta. This region is not isothermal, but contains material at a wide range of temperatures. Mass of the shocked ejecta is estimated to be in the range 10<sup>-7</sup> -10<sup>-6</sup> $M_\odot$ Based on the number of H- and He-ionizing photons, we estimate that the ionizing source evolved from a radius and temperature of ($2 \times 10^{12}$ cm, $3 \times 10^4$ K) on day 32 to ($6 \times 10^9$ cm, $3.6 \times 10^5$ K) on day 204.</p>
					<p>We also present the spectra of RS Oph recorded in quiescent phase, 2 and 3 years after outburst, for comparison. The spectrum is dominated by that of M2 giant secondary, with superposed emission lines of Œó and He<sub>I</sub>.</p>

					<p>The relation between the planetary distance law and the resonant structures in the solar system and in the satellite systems is shown, in that, the resonance relation has been expressed in terms of Roche‚Äôs (Bode‚Äôs) constant defined in the text. This brings forth a coherent, elegant and unified picture of the formation and structure of the solar system and the satellite systems. The Roche‚Äôs (Bode‚Äôs) constant is seen to play a central role in this unified picture, in that, it also appears to govern the resonance phenomenon in the systems.</p>

				<title>Multiple Shocks in the Rotating Winds from Self-Gravitating Discs</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0261-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present the analytic theory of dissipative and non-dissipative shocks in the rotating outflows in both the pseudo-Newtonian and the Schwarzschild geometry. We include the effects of the self gravity of the surrounding massive disc and show that the flow may have as many as five critical points when the angular momentum and the disc mass are sufficiently high. This leads to the possibility of the multiple <i>annular</i> shocks within the flow. We derive the expressions correlating the pre-shock and the post-shock quantities for all the three principal types of discontinuities. From these relations it is shown that for given initial flow parameters such as the angular momentum and the energy there could be as many as eighteen formal shock locations out of which at most two are chosen in reality. Detailed classification of the parameter space in terms of the initial flow parameters will be discussed elsewhere.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The collisionless Boltzmann equation governing self-gravitating systems such as galaxies has recently been shown to admit exact oscillating solutions with planar and spherical symmetry. The relation of the spherically symmetric solutions to the Virial theorem, as well as generalizations to non-uniform spheres, uniform spheroids and discs form the subject of this paper. These models generalize known families of static solutions. The case of the spheroid is worked out in some detail. Quasiperiodic as well as chaotic time variation of the two axes is demonstrated by studying the surface of section for the associated Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. The relation to earlier work and possible implications for the general problem of collisionless relaxation in self gravitating systems are also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Photoelectric and photographic photometry of 72 stars was done in the field of the not-well-studied open cluster Czernik 20 ‚â° OCl 427 in the direction of the Auriga constellation. Of these stars, a total of 43 have been found to be probable members down to $m_v \simeq 15.75$mag. There is apparently a variable extinction across the field of the cluster with ùê∏(ùêµ ‚Äì ùëâ) ranging from 0.53 to 0.38 mag. The cluster stars show a range in their ages from $1.0 \times 10^7$ to $7.1 \times 10^7$ years, indicating that Czernik 20 is young enough to be considered as a spiral-arm tracer in the study of our Galaxy. The distance of this cluster is found to be 4.27 ¬± 0.14 kpc and it is located inside the outer Perseus arm of the Milky Way.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The extensive ùëàùêµùëâ observations of SV Camelopardalis by Patkos (1982) have been analysed to derive the orbital elements of the system. The data were corrected for the effect of third body (Sarma, Sarma &amp; Abhyankar 1985) and for the ‚ÄòRS CVn‚Äô distortion wave (Sarma, Vivekanandarao &amp; Sarma 1988). The cleaned data were used to obtain a preliminary solution by a modified version of Wellmann method (Sarma &amp; Abhyankar 1979) from which we concluded that the primary eclipse is a transit. The final orbital elements of SV Cam were obtained by the modified version (Sarma 1988; Sarma <i>et al.</i> 1987) of WINK program by Wood (1972). The colour and median brightness variation are discussed. From the spectroscopic mass function ùëì(ùëö) = 0.118 $Œú_\odot$ (Hiltner 1953), the absolute dimensions of the components are found to be $0.826 M_\odot$ &amp; $0.592 M_\odot$ and $1.236 R_\odot$ &amp; $0.778 R_\odot$ for the primary and secondary components, respectively. The age of the binary system is estimated to be $6.0 \pm 1.0 \times 10^8$ years</p>

				<title>Stability of Resonant Planetary Orbits in Binary Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0347-0365</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper contains a numericalstudy of the stability of resonant orbits in a planetary system consisting of two planets, moving under the gravitational attraction of a binary star. Its results are expected to provide us with useful information about real planetary systems and, at the same time, about periodic motions in the general four-body problem (G4) because the above system is a special case of G4 where two bodies have much larger masses than the masses of the other two (planets). The numerical results show that the main mechanism which generates instability is the destruction of the Jacobi integrals of the massless planets when their masses become nonzero and that resonances in the motion of planets do not imply, in general, instability. Considerable intervals of stable resonant orbits have been found. The above quantitative results are in agreement with the existing qualitative predictions</p>

				<title>Analysis of Ca<sup>+</sup> K Plage Area for Short Period Variation</title>

				<page>0381-0389</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have analysed the observations of Solar Ca<sup>+</sup>K daily plage area for the period 1951-1977 to find evidence for the existence of short period (around 12-13 days) variation in the data. We divided the data in three groups-two corresponding to $10-20^\circ$N and $10-20^\circ$S latitude belts, and one corresponding to the total plage area-and used the power spectrum and autocorrelation techniques for the analysis. Both the techniques clearly show the 27-day periodicity due to solar rotation modulation in all the sets. A 12‚Äì13 day periodicity is seen in only 3, out of a total of 57 data sets when autocorrelation technique is used. A generally weak peak around 12‚Äì13 days is, however, seen in the power spectrum of all the data sets. The relative power in the 12‚Äì13 day peak is found to be significantly higher in those three data sets where the autocorrelation also shows this periodicity. On these two epochs the sunspot area distribution showed the existence of two distinct active longitudes separated by about 140‚Äì170 degrees. This seems to be the cause for the existence of a periodicity around 12‚Äì13 days in the autocorrelation and enhancement in the relative power of the 12‚Äì13 days peak in the power spectrum of these two epochs.</p>

				<title>Nature and Distribution of Dark matter: 2. Binaries, Groups and Clusters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0425-0432</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We study the mass-radius relationship for aggregates of galaxies, viz. binaries, small groups and clusters. The data are subjected to a simple best-fit analysis similar to the one carried out earlier for individual field galaxies. The analysis shows that: (i) The data on binary galaxies are consistent with the assumption that binaries are just two galaxies, each with an individual isothermal (ùëÄ ‚àù ùëÖ) dark matter halo, moving under the mutual gravitational attraction, (ii) The data on the groups of galaxies are too scattered to obey a single power-law relation of the form ùëÄ = ùëòùëÖ<sup>ùëõ</sup> with any degree of reliability, (iii) The data on groups and clusters fit better with a law of the form ùëÄ = ùê¥ùëÖ<sup>3</sup>+ ùêµùëÖ. This form suggests the existence of two components in dark matter-one which is clustered around the galaxies (ùëÄ ‚àù ùëÖ) and another which is distributed smoothly (ùëÄ ‚àù ùëÖ<sup>3</sup>). The smooth distributions becomes significant only at scales $\geq 1$ Mpc and hence does not affect binaries significantly. We briefly discuss the theoretical implications of this snalysis.</p>

				<title>The in-Plane Motion of a Geosynchronous Satellite under the Gravitational Attraction of the Sun, the Moon and the Oblate Earth</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0010</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The in-plane motion of a Geosynchronous satellite under the gravitational effects of the sun, the moon and the oblate earth has been studied. The radial deviation $(\Delta r)$ and the tangential deviation $(r_c \Delta \theta)$ have been determined. Here rc represents the synchronous altitude. It has been seen that the sum of the oscillatory terms in $\Delta r$ for different inclinations is a small finite quantity whereas the sum of the oscillatory terms in $r_c \Delta \theta$ for different inclinations is quite large due to the presence of the low-frequency terms in the denominator</p>

				<title>On the Effect of the Eccentricity of a Planetary Orbit on the Stability of Satellite Orbits</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0011-0022</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of the eccentricity of a planet‚Äôs orbit on the stability of the orbits of its satellites is studied. The model used is the elliptic Hill case of the planar restricted three-body problem. The linear stability of all the known families of periodic orbits of the problem is computed. No stable orbits are found, the majority of them possessing one or two pairs of real eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix, while a part of a family with complex instability is found. Two families of periodic orbits, bifurcating from the Lagrangian points L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub> of the corresponding circular case are found analytically. These orbits are very unstable and the determination of their stability coefficients is not accurate, so we compute the largest Liapunov exponent in their vicinity. In all cases these exponents are positive, indicating the existence of chaotic motions.</p>

The presence of [S II] ùúÜ4068 indicates the presence of planetary-nebulae-like envelope around the star.

				<title>Relativistic Magnetofluid Disc with nonzero Radial Velocity in Schwarzschild Geometry</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0066</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this paper we consider the equilibrium of a magnetofluid disc in Schwarzschild background with an external magnetic field, having the azimuthal and the radial components of the flow velocity nonzero. The electrical conductivity ùúé of the fluid is taken to be finite and thus the solution for the electromagnetic field is required to satisfy the Ohm's law too with the four-current having only $J^\phi$ and $J^t$ nonzero. The various phusical parameters that have to correlate for possible equilibrium configurations are identified and their respective magnitudes estimated. It is found that for a given angular momentum distribution the inner edge of the disc can reach well within the usual 6m limit only when the surface magnetic field of the central object is not too high when the matter density at the outer edge of the disc and the accretion rate are taken with reasonable limits</p>

				<title>On the Morphology of Supernova Remnants with Pulsars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0125-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the intriguing aspects of supernova remnants is their morphology. While the majority of them look like hollow shells, a few, called plerions, are centrally filled like the Crab nebula, and some have a shell-plerion combination morphology. The centrally-filled component in these remnants is believed to be powered by a central pulsar. In this paper we present results of model calculations of the evolution of surface brightness and morphology of supernova remnants containing pulsars. We discuss how the morphology of a supernova remnant will depend on the velocity of expansion, the density of the ambient medium into which it is expanding, and the initial period and magnetic field strength of the central pulsar.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents a novel technique to derive the absolute time of occurrence of an event with an accuracy of &lt; 200 ¬µs by adapting the HF time synchronization technique to correct for the aging rate and the frequency drift of a temperature-controlled quartz frequency standard. The propagation delay suffered by the HF time signals has been estimated by monitoring the clock error with respect to time signals from five broadcast stations located at distances in the range 500‚Äì3700 km from Gulmarg. Using simulated data, we further show the viability of this technique in permitting periodicity searches on timescales of ‚â• 5 milliseconds in cosmic gamma-ray data.</p>

The study extending to stars ùëâ ~ 21 magnitude establishes the distance modulus as (ùëö ‚Äî ùëÄ)<sub>0</sub> = 12.9 + 0.1 for the cluster. Based on the fitting of theoretical isochrones computed for solar metallicity, an age of 5(¬±1) √ó 10<sup>8</sup> years has been assigned to the cluster.

					<p>We have solved the equation of radiative transfer with Comptonscattering. The specific intensity has been expanded by Taylor series with respect to wavelength and the first three terms have been retained in solving the transfer equation. It is noted that in a medium stratified in plane parallel layers, the multiple Compton scattering redistributes the initial energy over a range of 3 to 5 Compton wavelengths. A good fraction of the incident radiation is transferred across the layer with redistribution in wavelength, the actual value depending on the optical thickness of the medium.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have used the Very Large Array to image a single field in a set of adjacent frequency bands around 333.0 MHz in an attempt to detect 21 cm emission from large scale Œó I inhomogeneities at a redshift of z = 3.3. Following the subtraction of continuum radio sources, the absence of any spectral signals apart from that expected due to the system thermal noise has been used to derive constraints on the evolutionary scenario leading to the formation of the present day clusters of galaxies. The observations rule out the existence of Œó I protoclusters at z = 3.3 with masses ‚âÉ 3.5 √ó 1014 ùëÄ<sub>‚äô</sub> in H I gas and space density exceeding (74 Mpc)<sup>-3</sup>. This indicates that the present day rich clusters of galaxies either formed as gaseous protocluster condensates prior to z = 3.3 or else they formed through the clustering of their constituent galaxies.</p>

				<title>An Observational Constraint on the Existence of Proto-Superclusters at z =3.3</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0237-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Observations have been conducted using the Ooty Radio Telescope in order to place constraints on the evolutionary scenario leading to the formation of the present day superclusters. The experiment attempted to detect 21cm emission from massive neutral hydrogen co condensates at a redshift of ùëß = 3.3. In an Einstein de-Sitter universe with baryon density Œ© = 0.05, about ten condensates were expected in the volume surveyed if superclusters, having H I masses ‚âÉ 5 √ó 10<sup>15</sup> ùëÄ<sub>‚äô</sub>, were the first objects to separate out of the Hubble expansion. The sensitivity of our experiment rules out the existence of these condensates at ùëß = 3.3 unless their lifetimes are less than one-tenth the dispersion in their epoch of formation or the proto-superclusters subtend angles greater than 6 arcmin. The result indicates that superclusters form at ùëß > 3.3 if indeed they were the first objects to condense out of the Hubble flow.</p>

					<p>6 Dra has long been known to show small variations in radial velocity, and there is photometric and spectroscopic evidence that its spectrum is composite.

				<page>0297-0310</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A 128-channel digital correlation reveiver has been built for the GEETEE<sup>1</sup>, the low-frequency radio telescope situated at Gauribidanur, South India, (latitude 13¬∞36'12''N). The receiver uses a modified dobulesideband (DSB) technique. The quadrature samples required for a DSB system are obtained by sampling the digitized intermediate frequency (I.F.) signals by two clocks which are separated in time by one quarter of the period of the I.F. The visibilities required for one-dimensional synthesis are measured using one-bit correlators. A technique to measure amplitude information for the signal using a threshold detector and a one-bit correlator has been developed. The receiver has been successfully used for continuum, spectral-line and pulsar observations. The antenna system of GEETEE and its configuration for one dimensional synthesis are also described in this paper.</p>

				<title>A Modified Algorithm for CLEANing Wide-Field Maps with Extended Structures</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0311-0322</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Œë simple but effective modification to the conventional CLEAN algorithm is suggested. This modification ensures both stability and speed when CLEAN is applied to maps containing a mixture of point sources and extended structures. The method has been successfully applied to the recently-completed sky survey at 34.5 MHz (Dwarakanath &amp; Udaya Shankar 1990). This survey was made using the Gauribidanur Œ§ array (GEETEE) 1 in 1-D aperture synthesis mode. Since in this case the ‚Äòdirty beam‚Äô (point spread function) cannot be directly computed, a method to obtain this is discussed in detail. The results of this deconvolution procedure have been encouraging in terms of reduced computing time and improved dynamic range in our maps. This algorithm should find wider application in deconvolving maps which have both extended structures and point sources.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This paper describes a wide-field survey made at 34.5 MHz using GEETEE<sup>1</sup>, the low frequency telescope at Gauribidanur (latitude 13¬∞36'12''N). This telescope was used in the transit mode and by performing 1-D synthesis along the north-south direction the entire observable sky was mapped in a single day. This minimized the problems that hinder wide-field low-frequency mapping. This survey covers the declination range of -50¬∞ to +70¬∞ (-33¬∞ to +61¬∞ without aliasing) and the complete 24 hours of right ascension. The synthesized beam has a resolution of 26'√ó 42' sec (Œ¥ -14¬∞.1). The sensitivity of the survey is 5 Jy/beam (1ùúé). Special care has been taken to ensure that the entenna responds to all angular scale structures and it suitable for studies of both point sources and extended objects.</p>

					<p>It is well-known that galaxies tend to form elongated associations stretching many degrees across the sky. It is shown here that especially galaxies of about 3000 to 5000 km s<sup>-1</sup> redshift define narrow filaments of from 10 to 50¬∞ in length. The surprising feature is that galaxies of very bright apparent magnitude tend to occur at the centre or ends of these alignments.

				<page>0515-0531</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The coherent plasma process such as parametric decay instability (PDI) has been applied to a homogeneous and unmagnetized plasma. These instabilities cause anomalous absorption of strong electromagnetic radiation under specific conditions of energy and momentum conservation and thus cause anomalous heating of the plasma. The maximum plasma temperatures reached are functions of luminosity of the radio radiation and plasma parameters. We believe that these processes may be taking place in many astrophysical objects. Here, the conditions in the sources 3C 273, 3C 48 and Crab Nebula are shown to be conducive to the excitation of PDI. These processes also contribute towards the absorption of 21cm radiation.</p>

				<page>0533-0540</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photoelectric radial-velocity measurements show that HD 118670 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary in an orbit which is not quite circular and whose period is about 48 days. Spectral types of K0 V and K7 V would satisfy the photometry and the mass ratio; the mass function would then suggest the possibility of eclipses. However, actual spectral classification indicates a luminosity somewhat above the main sequence.</p>

				<title>Some Consequences of a Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant in a Spherically Symmetric Distribution of Matter </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0007-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper investigates the effects of the spatial variation of the cosmological constant ùõ¨ on the spacetime geometry within and outside a massive object. It is seen that the variation of ùõ¨ with the radial coordinate introduces non-trivial changes leading to spacetime closing on itself around a massive object. It may also be possible to generate interior solutions that lead to flat rotation curves of galaxies.</p>

					<p>We estimate the contribution of millisecond pulsars to the diffuse gamma-ray background of the Galaxy, and show that a significant fraction of the Galactic background may originate from them. A small number of the unidentified COS-B point sources may, in fact, be millisecond pulsars. It is argued that several hundred millisecond pulsars may be detectable as point sources by the GRO satellite.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0027-0037</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The long period classical cepheid RZ Vel (HD 73502) is known to be a member of an OB association, Vel OB1 in Vela, and a high metallicity is ascribed to it by the photometric work of Eggen (1982). We have done an abundance analysis for this long period (ùëÉ = 20.4 days) and hence young (age ‚âà 1.80 √ó 10<sup>7</sup> yr) classical cepheid using high resolution CCD spectra with good S/N ratio. We have used a detailed model atmosphere method to derive the abundances of the light elements C, O, A1, S and of many Fe-peak elements and a few s-process elements. Our present work indicates near solar abundance for most of the elements for RZ Vel and hence we do not confirm the high metallicity derived photometrically by Eggen (1982) for this star.</p>

				<title>A Study of the Distortion Wave in the RS CVn Eclipsing Binary SV Camelopardalis</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0049-0067</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The light outside the eclipses of the totally eclipsing RS CVn binary SV Camelopardalis (SV Cam) is Fourier analysed and the amp;itudes of the distrotion waves have been derived. The distribution of the percentage contributions of these amplitudes in ùëâ, ùêµ and ùëà colours with respect to the luminosites of the binary components indicates that the hotter component is the source of the distortion waves. These distortion waves, attributed to star spots, are modelled according to Budding (1977) and spot parameters like longitude, latitude, temperature and size are obtained. From this study it is noticed that while symmetric waves with two minima could be fitted satisfactorily, asymmetric waves with more than two minima could not be fitted well. From the longitudes of the minima of the best fitted curves, migration periods of four spot groups are determined. Assuming synchronism between rotation and orbital periods, the rotation periods of the four spot groups are derived from their migration periods. The period of rotation of one of the spot groups having direct motion is found to be 0<sup>d</sup>d.5934209 while the periods of the other three spot groups having retrograde motion are 0<sup>d</sup>.5926588, 0<sup>d</sup>.592607 and 0<sup>d</sup>.5924688. As the latitudes of these spots are known from modelling parameters, the latitude having a rotation period equal to that of the orbital period (co-rotating latitude) is found to be about 30¬∞.</p>

				<page>0069-0087</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Results of the observations of mutual eclipses of Galilean satellites observed from the Vainu Bappu Observatory during 1985 are presented. Theoretical models assuming a uniform disc, Lambert‚Äôs law and Lommel-Seeliger‚Äôs law describing the scattering characteristics of the surface of the eclipsed satellite were used to fit the observations. Light curves of the 1E2 event on 1985 September 24 and the 3E1 event on 1985 October 24 observed from VBO and published light curves of the 1E2 event on 1985 September 14, the 3E1 event on 1985 September 26 and the 2E1 event on 1985 October 28 (Arlot <i>et al</i> 1989) were fitted with theoretical light curves using Marquardt‚Äôs algorithm. The best fitting was obtained using Lommel-Seeliger‚Äôs law to describe the scattering over the surface of IŒø and Europa. During the fitting, a parameter Œ¥ùúí<sub>shift</sub> which shifts the theoretical light curve along the direction of relative motion of the eclipsed satellite with respect to the shadow centre, on the sky plane (as seen from the Sun) was determined along with the impact parameter. In absence of other sources like prominent surface features or non perfect sky conditions which could lead to asymmetric light curves, Œ¥ùúí<sub>shift</sub> would be a measure of the phase correction (Aksnes, Franklin &amp; Magnusson 1986) with an accuracy as that of the midtime. Heliocentric ùõ•Œ± cos (Œ¥) and ùõ•Œ¥ at mid times derived from fitted impact parameters are reported.</p>

				<title>Ejections of Quasars at Relativistic Speeds from Nearby Galaxies: Ejection Mechanism and Selection Effects</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0091-0110</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has become part of the conventional wisdom of quasar research that quasars cannot be objects ejected from nearby galaxies. The reasons are summarized in Burbidge &amp; Burbidge (1967) and they include: (1) in quasar spectra only redshifts, and no blueshifts, are observed, contrary to expectation in a local Doppler interpretation of quasar line shifts; (2) the energy requirements for relativistically moving quasars seem excessive and the ejection mechanism is unknown. In. this work we show that the first problem could be explained via some powerful selection effects, and that the second problem does not exist in the relativistic slingshot process of ejecting black holes. Consequently one cannot exclude the possibility that at least some of the quasar-galaxy associations of large redshift differentials discussed by Arp and Sulentic are real and that the redshift differences are due to high speeds of ejected quasars.</p>

				<title>Emission-Line CCD Imaging of Three Southern Symbiotic Stars</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0111-0117</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Symbiotic stars that are strong radio sources and have cool dust emitting in the infrared are expected to have extended emission nebulae around them. In order to search for such emission nebulae, we have carried out CCD imaging of three symbiotic stars (R Aqr, RR Tel and Œó1-36) with narrow-band filters centred at the emission lines of [O III] ùúÜ5007, Hùõº Œª6563, [N II] ùúÜ6584, [S II] ùúÜ6717 + 6731. RR Tel and H1-36 images do not show any extended nebulosities around them. The CCD image of the R Aqr nebulosity in the high excitation [O III] line is different from its image in HŒ± and the low excitation lines of [Œù II] and [S II] indicating ionization-stratification in the nebula. In H1-36 the optical nebulosity (if it exists) is smaller than ~ 2 arcsec while the radio image size is known to be large (~ 5 arcsec). This behaviour is opposite to that seen in R Aqr in which the radio emission comes from the core region of a much larger optical nebulosity. Interstellar and/or circumstellar extinctions are suggested to be responsible for this difference.</p>

				<title>MK Morphological Study of Am Stars at 66 √Ö/mm</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0133-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The pseudo-luminosity effect in the metallic line A-type stars found by Abt &amp; Morgan (1976) is confirmed in a random sample of 27 Am stars. From a morphological study of their spectra in the wavelength interval 3850‚Äì4400 √Ö at a reciprocal dispersion of 66 √Ö/mm, revised spectral types are given on the MK system for their K-line and metallic-line spectra. This shows that: (a) our segregation of weak Am from the Am stars largely agrees with that by Cowley <i>et al.</i> (1969); (b) all the stars in the sample are dwarfs according to their K-line classification; (c) more than 80 per cent exhibit the pseudo-luminosity effect significantly, with their metallic-line spectra resembling a giant or even a supergiant in the violet (3850‚Äì4100 √Ö), and a giant rather than a dwarf in the blue region (4260-4400 √Ö); (d) in two-thirds of the stars under (c), the Sr II 4077 √Ö line is found to have a markedly brighter luminosity class compared to any region, and in more than one-third of the sample it is comparable to that in Ap stars; (e) at least five stars exhibit characteristics which might suggest a spectrum variability: among these, the most striking example is 41 Sex A which was found to show a phase-modulated spectrum variation hitherto unknown in Am stars; (f) the metallic-line spectra of another five stars appear to be similar to A-shell type in differing degrees; (g) less than 20 per cent of the sample comprises stars which do not show any significant differential luminosity effect; these stars might have been misclassified or perhaps they are in a quiescent state</p>
					<p>We also confirm the conclusion arrived at by B√∂hm-Vitense &amp; Johnson (1978) that all Am stars may vary and our observations suggest that groups may exist among them.</p>

				<page>0179-0185</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The integrated magnitudes of 221 Galactic open clusters have been used to derive the luminosity function. The completeness of the data has also been discussed. In the luminosity distribution the maximum frequency of clusters occurs near ùêº (ùëÄ<sub>ùë£</sub>) = ‚Äì 3<sup>m</sup>5, and some plausible reasons for a sharp cut-off at ùêº (ùëÄ<sub>ùë£</sub>) = ‚Äì 2<sup>m</sup> 0 have been discussed. It is concluded that the paucity of the clusters fainter than ùêº (ùëÄ<sub>ùë£</sub>) = ‚Äì 2<sup>m</sup> 0 is not purely due to selection effects. The surface density of the clusters for different magnitude intervals has. been obtained using the completeness radius estimated from the log ùëÅ‚Äìlog ùëë plots. A relation between ùêº (ùëÄ<sub>ùë£</sub>) and surface density has been obtained which yields a steeper slope than that obtained by van den Bergh &amp; Lafontaine (1984).</p>

Out of these stars, a total of 22 down to ùëö<sub>ùë£</sub> ‚âÉ 15.4 mag have been found to be probable members. There is apparently a variable extinction across the field of the cluster with ùê∏(ùêµ ‚Äì ùëâ) ranging between 0.84 mag and 0.68 mag. The median age of this cluster is estimated to be 7.6 √ó 10<sup>7</sup> years and the cluster is thereby considered as belonging to the marginally old category. Thus, it cannot be specifically used as a spiral arm tracer in the study of our Galaxy. This cluster is located at a distance of 3.72 ¬± 0.13 kpc, which places it at the inner edge of the outer Perseus spiral feature of the Milky Way.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have studied the Vela supernova remnant in the light of the 34.5 MHz observations made with the GEETEE low frequency array. The flux densities of Vela X and YZ at 34.5 MHz are estimated to be 1800 and 3900 Jy respectively. These values, along with those from earlier observations ate higher frequencies, imply spectral indices (S ‚àù ùë£<sup>ùõº</sup>) of -0.16 ¬± 0.02 for Vela X and ‚Äì0.53 ¬± 0.03 for Vela YZ. This situation is further substantiated by the spectral-index distribution over the region obtained between 34.5 and 408 MHz.</p>
					<p>The spectral-index estimates, along with other known characteristics, strengthen the earlier hypothesis that Vela X is a plerion, while Vela YZ is a typical shell-type supernova remnant. We discuss the implications of this result.</p>

					<p>BU Tauri (Pleione) an interesting star in the Pleiades cluster, has been observed spectrophotometrically. The energy distribution curves  of the star have been discussed vis a vis model atmospheres for normal stars  in the appropriate range of temperature and effective gravity. The changes in the energy distribution curve noticed during our observations and previous observations taken from the literature have been pointed out. On the basis of the measured HŒ± emission equivalent width, a rough estimate of the dimensions of the extended envelope of the star has been made.</p>

				<title>Spot Modelling and Elements of the RS CVn Eclipsing Binary WY Cancri</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0225-0263</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Results of analysis of aphotoelectric observations of the RS CVn eclipsing binary WY Cancri in the standard passbands of ùëàùêµùëâ during 1973-74, 1976-79 and in ùëàùêµùëâùëÖùêº during 1984-86 are reported. A preliminary analysis of the eclipses suggested the primary eclipse to be transit. A study of the percentage contribution of the distortion wave amplitudes in all the colours with respect to the luminosities of both components, showed the hotter component to be the source of the distortion wave. The clean (wave removed) light curves of different epochs have not merged, suggesting residual effects of spot activity. The reason for this is attributed to the presence of either (1) polar spots or (2) small spots uniformly distributed all over the surface of the hotter component. This additional variation is found to have a periodicity of about 50 years or more. The distortion waves in yellow colour are modelled according to Budding‚Äôs (1977) method. For getting the best fit of the observations and theory, it was found necessary to assume three or four spots on the surface of the hot component. Out of these four spot groups, three are found to have direct motion with migration periods of 1.01, 1.01 and 2.51 years while the fourth one has a retrograde motion with a migration period of 3.01 years. From these periods and the latitudes of the spots derived from the model a co-rotating latitude of 4¬∞ is obtained. The temperatures of these spots are found to be lower than that of the photosphere by about 700¬∞K to 800¬∞K. Assuming  the light curve of 1985‚Äì86, which is the brightest of all the observed seasons, to be least affected by the spots, the light curves of the other seasons are all brought up to the quadrature level of this season by applying suitable corrections. The merged curves in the UBVRI colours are analysed for the elements by the Wilson-Devinney method. This analysis yielded the following absolute elements</p>
					<p>\begin{align*}  
							m_h &amp; = 0.85 \pm 0,03 M_\odot\\
							m_h &amp; = 0.51 \pm 0.03 M_\odot\\
							R_h &amp; = 0.99 \pm 0.02 R_\odot\\
							R_c &amp; = 0.65 \pm 0.02 R_\odot\\
							T_h &amp; = 5520^\circ K \pm 100^\circ K\\
							T_c &amp; = 3740^\circ K \pm 20^\circ K\\
							M_{\text{h(bol)}} &amp; = 4^m.96 \pm 0.10\\
							M_{\text{c(bol)}} &amp; = 7^m.58 \pm 0.15\\
							\text{Spectral type} &amp; \qquad \text{hotter component} = G5 \pm 1\\
							&amp; \qquad \text{cooler component} = K9 \pm 1
					   \end{align*}
				   </p>
				   <p>For a mass ratio of 0.506 and with the derived fractional radii ùëü<sub>‚Ñé</sub> = 0.241 and ùëü<sub>ùëê</sub> = 0.157, both the components are found to be within their Roche lobes. Hence we have classified WY Cnc as a detached system. From their positions on the HR diagram it is concluded that both the components of WY Cnc belong to the main sequence.</p>

					<p>Photoelectric radial-velocity measurements show that HD 111068 is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 206 days. The primary star is probably about type K5 III; the secondary, only detected through the photometric compositeness of the system, may well be an F dwarf. The orbit is circular within observational uncertainty; it is near the upper limit of periods for which tidal circularization operates for giant stars.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present here rigorous analytical solutions for the Boltzmann-Poisson equation concerning the distribution of stars above the galactic plane. The number density of stars is considered to follow a behaviour ùëõ(ùëö, 0) ~ ùêª(ùëö ‚Äì ùëö0)ùëö<sup>-ùë•</sup>, where ùëö is the mass of a star and ùë• an arbitrary exponent greater than 2 and also the velocity dispersion of the stars is assumed to behave as ‚å©ùë£<sup>2</sup> (ùëö)‚å™ ~ ùëö<sup>-ùúÉ</sup> the exponent ùúÉ being arbitrary and positive. It is shown that an analytic expression can be found for the gravitational field ùêæ<sub>ùëß</sub>, in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions, the limiting trends being ùêæ<sub>ùëß</sub> ~ ùëß for ùëß‚Üí0, while Kùëß ‚Üí constant for ùëß ‚Üí infinity. We also study the behaviour of ‚å©|ùëß(ùëö)|<sup>2</sup>‚å™, i.e. the dispersion of the distance from the galactic disc for the stars of mass ùëö. It is seen that the quantity ‚å©|ùëß(ùëö)|2‚å™ ~ ùëö‚ÄìùúÉ, for ùëö‚Üí‚àû, while it departs significantly from this harmonic oscillator behaviour for stars of lighter masses. It is suggested that observation of ‚å©|ùëß(ùëö)|2‚å™ can be used as a probe to find ùë• and hence obtain information about the mass spectrum.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0281-0287</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present photoelectric photometry of ùúÜ And never before published, obtained between February 1982 and December 1990 at 29 different observatories. Then we combine it with all other photometry available to us (previously published, contained in the I.A.U. Commission 27 Archives, and obtained with the Vanderbilt 16-inch automatic telescope but not yet published), to yield a 14.8-year data base. Analysis reveals a long-term cycle in mean brightness, with a full range of 0<sup>m</sup>.15 and a period of 11.4 ¬± 0.4 years. Because most of our new photometry was concentrated in the 1983‚Äì84 observing season, we analyze that one well-defined light curve with a two-spot model. Spot A keeps a 0<sup>m</sup>.04 amplitude throughout four rotation cycles whereas the amplitude of spot Œí diminishes from 0<sup>m</sup>.09 down almost to 0<sup>m</sup>.03. The spot rotation periods were 55<sup>d</sup>.9 ¬± 0<sup>d</sup>.6 and 52<sup>d</sup>.8 ¬± 1<sup>d</sup>.0, respectively</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The line intensity of the green coronal line and the continuum intensity are derived from the filter and white light photographs of the solar corona obtained during the 1980 total solar eclipse. Ratio of the line to continuum intensity is plotted against the radial distance ùëü(=ùëÖ/ùëÖ<sub>0</sub>, ùëÖ<sub>0</sub> is the solar radius), in various position angles . A simple model assuming an electron density dependence of the line and continuum intensities suggests a dominant collisional mechanism for the excitation of the line in the innermost regions (~ 1.4 ùëÖ<sub>0</sub>). The measured line to continuum ratio tends to a constant value at different radial distances in different position angles. The constancy of the measured line to continuum ratio indicates significant radiative excitation beyond 1.4 ùëÖ<sub>0</sub>, in some of the position angles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Calibration of the CCD camera of the 1m telescope at the Vainu Bappu Observatory, Kavalur, to the ùêµ ùëâ ùëÖ system is reported here based on the observations of stars in the ‚Äòdipper asterism‚Äô in the open cluster Œú 67 (NGC 2682). Transformations involving ùêµ and ùëâ have negligible colour terms, while those involving ùëÖ are slightly colour dependent. The possibility of using scaled-down ùëÖ band fluxes to estimate the continuum flux at HŒ± is investigated by comparing the counts in ùëÖ band with those through an interference filter centred at HŒ±. The scaling factor is found to remain constant over a wide range of colours. The sensitivity of the telescope-filter-CCD combination is estimated to be 2.0 per cent, 8.3 per cent and 9.7 per cent in ùêµ, ùëâ and ùëÖ bands, respectively. The star F117 appears to be a small-amplitude (~ 0.05 mag) variable.</p>

				<title>Evolution of Massive Binary Stars in the LMC and its Implications for Radio Pulsar Population</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0003-0052</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the Large Magellanic Cloud compiled recently by Fitzpatrick &amp; Garmany (1990) shows that there are a number of supergiant stars immediately redward of the main sequence although theoretical models of massive stars with normal hydrogen abundance predict that the region 4.5 ‚â§ log ùëá<sub>eff</sub> ‚â§ 4.3 should be un-populated ("gap"). Supergiants having surface enrichment of helium acquired for example from a previous phase of accretion from a binary companion, however, evolve in a way so that the evolved models and observed data are consistent ‚Äì an observation first made by Tuchman &amp; Wheeler (1990). We compare the available optical data on OB supergiants with computed evolutionary tracks of massive stars of metallicity relevant to the LMC with and without helium-enriched envelopes and conclude that a large fraction (‚âà 60 per cent) of supergiant stars may occur in binaries. As these less evolved binaries will later evolve into massive X-ray binaries, the observed number and orbital period distribution of the latter can constrain the evolutionary scenarios of the supergiant binaries. The distributions of post main sequence binaries and closely related systems like WR + O stars are bimodal‚Äìconsisting of close and wide binaries in which the latter type is numerically dominating. When the primary star explodes as a supernova leaving behind a neutron star, the system receives a kick and in some cases can lead to runaway O-stars. We calculate the expected space velocity distribution for these systems. After the second supernova explosion, the binaries in most cases, will be disrupted leading to two runaway neutron stars. In between the two explosions, the first born neutron star's spin evolution will be affected by accretion of mass from the companion star. We determine the steady-state spin and radio luminosity distributions of single pulsars born from the massive stars under some simple assumptions. Due to their great distance, only the brightest radio pulsars may be detected in a flux-limited survey of the LMC. A small but significant number of observable single radio pulsars arising out of the disrupted massive binaries may appear in the short spin period range. Most pulsars will have a low velocity of ejection and therefore may cluster around the OB associations in the LMC.</p>

				<title>Effects of Rotation on the Colours and Line Indices of Stars 5. The ZRMS and the ZRZAMS</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0061-0107</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The observed ùë¢ùë£ùëèùë¶  and HùõΩ indices of member stars of the Hyades and Praesepe clusters have been analysed in detail for rotation effects. The Alpha Persei, Pleiades and the Centaurus subgroup of the Scorpio‚ÄìCentaurus association have been reanalysed using the observed indices instead of the extinction-corrected indices used earlier. The observed rotation effects from the analysis of these cluster data are found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of Collins &amp; Sonneborn (1977). We have also analysed the ùõΩ, ùëê and (ùë¢ ‚Äì ùëè) values of the member stars of NGC 1976, 2264, 2287, 2422, 4755,1C 2391, IC 2602 and IC 4665 for rotation effects. The results are found to be consistent with the theoretical predictions</p>
					<p>The observed slopes of the rotation effects were used to determine the zero rotation main sequence values of the intermediate band photometric indices for selected clusters. We also corrected the observed indices for each star in each cluster using the theoretical predictions of Collins and Sonneborn and derived the ZRMS values for each cluster. The agreement between the two determinations is found to be good. The various ZRMS curves were utilised to derive the ZRZAMS values. A preliminary calibration of the absolute visual magnitudes as a function of ùõΩ valid for ZRZAMS has also been derived. The ZRMS values of the intermediate band photometric indices for different clusters and the ZRZAMS values are listed as a function of ùõΩ.</p>

				<title>Effects of Rotation on the Colours and Line Indices of Stars 6. The Reality of the Blue Straggler Phenomenon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0109-0128</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The effect of rotation on the observed colours of stars has been considered as a possible cause for the blue straggler phenomenon in clusters listed by Mermilliod (1982). It appears that this phenomenon is definitely not real in the case of the late Œí and early A spectral type blue stragglers that are intrinsic slow rotators. Among clusters containing the early Œí type blue stragglers it is found that the anomalous position of the stragglers in NGC 6633, NGC 6475 and NGC 2516 cannot be accounted for by rotation effects alone.</p>

				<title>Gain Calibration of CCD Systems at VBO</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0129-0144</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The system gain of two CCD systems in regular use at the Vainu Bappu Observatory, Kavalur, is determined at a few gain settings. The procedure used for the determination of system gain and base-level noise is described in detail. The Photometrics CCD system at the 1-m reflector uses a Thomson-CSF TH 7882 CDA chip coated for increased ultraviolet sensitivity. The gain is programme-selected through the parameter ‚Äòcgain‚Äô varying between 0 and 4095 in steps of 1. The inverse system gain for this system varies almost linearly from 27.7 electrons DN<sup>-1</sup> at cgain = 0 to 1.5 electrons DN<sup>-1</sup> at cgain = 500. The readout noise is ‚â§ 11 electrons at cgain = 66. The Astromed CCD system at 2.3-m Vainu Bappu Telescope uses a GEC P8603 chip which is also coated for enhanced ultraviolet sensitivity. The amplifier gain is selected in discrete steps using switches in the controller. The inverse system gain is 4.15 electrons DN<sup>-1</sup> at the gain setting of 9.2, and the readout noise ‚àº 8 electrons.</p>				</abstract>

				<abstract>
					<p>The behaviour of pulsars at low radio-frequencies (below ~ 50 MHz) remains poorly understood mainly due to very limited observational data on pulsars at these frequencies. We report here our measurements of pulse profiles at 34.5 MHz of 8 pulsars using the Gauribidanur Radio Telescope none of the 8 pulsars show any significant interpulse emission at this frequency which conflicts with an earlier claim from 25 MHz observations. With the exception of one pulsar (PSR 0943 + 10) all the observed pulsars show turnovers at frequencies above 35 MHz in their spectra. We also report our attempts to study the short and long term variations in the pulsar signals at this low frequency.</p>

					<p>High speed photometry during the lunar occultation of a stellar system provides an effective means of achieving high angular resolution in one dimension at the sub arc second level which is well suited for resolving close binary projected separations in the range of 10‚Äì100 milliarc seconds.

				<abstract>
					<p>We report a study of the kinematics of the cometary globules in the Gum Nebula using the ùêΩ= 1 ‚Üí 0 transition line of <sup>12</sup>CO. A morphological center for the system with which 60% of the globules are associated is identified. It is shown that the observed radial velocities of the heads of the globules are consistent with an expansion of the system. Systematic velocity gradients are present along some of the tails. The estimated <i>expansion age</i> and the <i>tail stretching age</i> are both ~ a few million years, suggesting a common origin for the expansion and the formation of the tails. The presence of young stars of similar ages in some of the globules points to star formation triggered by the same cause. Possible scenarios are briefly discussed.</p>

				<title>SiO Maser Emission and the Intrinsic Properties of Mira Variables</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0241-0265</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>This paper presents observations of SiO maser emission from 161 Mira variables distributed over a wide range of intrinsic parameters like spectral type, bolometric magnitude and amplitude of pulsation. The observations were made at 86.243 GHz, using the 10¬∑4 m millimeter-wave telescope of the Raman Research Institute at Bangalore, India. These are the first observations made using this telescope. From these observations, we have established that the maser emission is restricted to Miras having mean spectral types between M6 and M10. The infrared period-luminosity relation for Mira variables is used to calculate their distances and hence estimate their maser luminosities from the observed fluxes. The maserluminosity is found to be correlated with the bolometric magnitude of the Mira variable. On an H‚ÄìR diagram, the masing Mira variables are shown to lie in a region distinct from that for the non-masing ones.</p>

				<page>0267-0277</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Photopolarimetric observations of comet Austin with the IAU/IHW filter system were obtained on the 2.34m Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, at Kavalur, India, during pre-perihelion phase on February 20,1990 and on the 1.2m telescope of the Physical Research Laboratory at Gurusikhar, Mount Abu during postperihelion phase on May 2 and 4, 1990. The comet appeared bluer than a solar analog during post-perihelion phase on May 2 and 4. The percent polarization shows a sharp increase towards the red on May 2 and 4. The dominant sizes of the dust particles appear to lie in a narrow range of 0.1 to  0.5 ¬µm. Regarding the molecular band emission, CN and C<sub>2</sub> bands are quite  strong; C<sub>3</sub> emission was also found to be strong though the observations on May 2 and 4 show significant variation as compared to C<sub>2</sub> emission.  Molecular band polarization for CN, C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O+ have been calculated. It has been found that emission polarization in CN, C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> is  between 1‚Äì7% (phase angle between 107.4‚Äì109 degrees). For CN and C<sub>2</sub> the polarization values are close to the theoretically predicted values, but for C<sub>3</sub> the polarization value falls much below the theoretically predicted value. A similar result was found for comet Halley.</p>

				<title>Globular Clusters as Gamma Ray Sources</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0287-0291</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>There are indications now that globular clusters contain a large number of low magnetic field millisecond pulsars. Since millisecond pulsars are expected to emit ùõæ-rays due to curvature radiation, it is likely that globular clusters will themselves be sources of ùõæ-rays bright enough to be detectable by present day instruments. Using the expression derived by Scharlemann, Arons &amp; Fawley (1978) of the energy acquired by the  electrons moving along the open magnetic field lines of the pulsars we have calculated the likely luminosity of ùõæ-rays from globular clusters. We discuss our results in the light of the calculations reported in the literature based on some of the other models.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present the results from CCD photometry in the ùëâ, ùëÖ and ùêº bands, of the ‚ÄòDipper Asterism‚Äô region of the open cluster Œú67 based on observations carried out at the prime focus of the 2.3 m Vainu Bappu Telescope of the Vainu Bappu Observatory, Kavalur. The CCD parameters like the system gain and the readout noise are measured using several flatfield frames taken through the standard ùêº filter. The CCD chip is calibrated using the photometric standards in the field and linear colour transformation relations are derived. Also a few new ùëâùëÖùêº photometric measurements are reported for the members of the cluster.</p>

Atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances are determined using detailed depth-dependent model atmospheres and line synthesis technique. Most of the elements show near solar abundances.</p>

				<page>0319-0326</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A dynamical model composed of a disk galaxy with an elliptic companion, moving in a circular orbit, is used in order to study the stellar orbits in a binary galaxy. Using the Poincare surface of section we study the evolution of the stochastic regions in the primary galaxy considering the mass of the companion or the value of the Jacobi‚Äôs integral as a parameter. Our numerical calculations suggest that the regions of stochasticity increase, as the mass of the companion or the value of the Jacobi‚Äôs integral increase. An interesting observation is that only direct orbits become stochastic.</p>

				<title>Physical Identification of Static and Axially-Symmetric Vacuum Metric Tensors</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0327-0347</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a method of a possible physical identification of the static and axially symmetric Weyl-type vacuum ùõæ and ùëõùõæ metrics. This method, in which no interior solutions of any kind are involved, is based  on the comparison of the far-field forms of the ùõæ and ùëõ metrics, and of the far-field form of the metric tensor due to a bounded gravitating  perfect-fluid source given correctly to post-Newtonian accuracy. The  parameters of the vacuum solutions are expressed in terms of physical parameters of a prolate fluid source, namely total mass-energy, semiaxes and eccentricity, defined consistently to post-Newtonian accuracy. The results, based on the otherwise arbitrary fluid source, appear physically  general. Possible astrophysical candidates for the far-field and ùëõùõæ metrics are proposed, based on the conditions imposed on them by the identification method. The advantages and deficiencies of the identification method are briefly discussed.</p>

					<p>Near infrared coronal line emission at 1.98 ¬± 0.02¬µm due to [Si VI] detected in the spectrum of Nova Herculis 1991 about 17 days after optical maximum is reported. The early appearance of coronal emission is yet another unusual feature of this fast nova in which early onset of dust formation processes and X-ray detection five days after outburst have already been reported. The coronal line observations reported here are consistent with X-ray detection and support a hot shocked circumstellar envelope at the periphery of the dust formation zone in the nova.</p>

				<page>0019-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The formation of spiral structure in a galaxy, as a result of the  gravitational perturbation caused by a permanent companion, is studied. It is found that spiral structure appears only when a resonance exists between the rotational frequency of the stars in the galaxy and the rotational frequency of the companion galaxy. The number of spiral arms depends strongly on the particular resonance. In the case where the companion moves in an elliptic orbit, spiral arms are formed when a resonance, inside the galactic body, exists in almost all the parts of the orbit or, at least, in the largest part of it.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0044</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Near infrared measurements in the J, Œó and Œö bands have been carried out for a number of symbiotic stars with the 1.5 m telescope at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO). A comparison with the earlier observations shows that the S-type symbiotic stars do not have any significant variation in the infrared flux over the past five years. However a small variation ~ 0¬∑3 magnitude in the infrared flux has been detected for CH Cygni. The observations of HM Sagittae show large decreases in the infrared flux compared to the previous measurements. The variability in the infrared fluxes of both these objects could be attributed to a variation in the temperature due to the cooling of the dust shell. The variability observed for V1016 Cygni is found consistent with the previous measurements.</p>

					<p>We have taken the case of a circular H filament observed on May 9, 1979 erupting into a double-ribbon flare associated witha a nonspot region. The plage motions are responsible for the filament reorientation and, here as a special case, wherein the filament attains a clear circular shape before the onset of a flare. We conclude that the change in the orientation of the H filament marks the instability giving rise to the flare.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have constructed the bolometric light curve of SN 1993J based on UBVRI(JHK) photometric data obtained from various sources and assuming ùê¥<sub>ùë£</sub> = 0 and a distance modulus of 27.6. Effective temperatures and photosphere radius at various times have been obtained from detailed blackbody fits. The bolometric light curve shows two maxima. The short rise time to the second maximum, and the luminosities at the minimum and the second maximum are used to constrain the properties of the progenitor star. The total mass of the hydrogen envelope MH, in the star is found to be $\lesssim 0¬∑2 M_\odot$ at the time of explosion, and the explosion ejected about $0.05 Œú_\odot$ of Ni<sup>56</sup>. Thin hydrogen envelope combined with a sufficient presupernova luminosity suggest that the exploding star was in a binary with a probable period range of 5yr ‚â§ ùëÉ<sub>orb</sub> ‚â§ 11yr.</p>

				<title>Bipolar Jets in Planetary Nebulae: An Analytical Model</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0065-0082</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The various and hitherto partially unsolved problems relative to the origin of bipolar jets or highly collimated fast outflows in planetary nebulae are reviewed within the framework of a sationary magnetohydrodynamic model.</p>
					<p>In order to explain the observations of high polar velocities and the presence of polar blobs or knots in planetary nebulae, theoretical models are proposed taking into account both a large scale azimuthal magnetic field and an anisotropic turbulent velocity field.</p>
					<p>The models predict equatorial-to-polar density ratios which are rather small, in the range 2 to 3. Conversely, the polar-to-equatorial velocity  contrasts are higher, with typical values upto 10. Thus the <i>ad hoc</i> hypothesis implicit in the literature that the density contrast is varying in inverse ratio to the velocity one, does not seem well adapted to the bipolar jet phenomenon in planetary nebulae.</p>
					<p>We point out, therefore, that the bipolar jets have to be considered as a transient aspect of a very complex phenomenon. The model can be  applied to objects such as He 2‚Äì104 or Mz3, M2‚Äì9.</p>

				<title>Chemical Evolution of the High Redshift Galaxies</title>

				<page>0083-0095</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>we have tried to determine the rate of chemical evolution of high redshift galaxies from the observed redshift distruibution of the heavy element absorption systems in the spectra of QSQs, taking into account the evolution in the intensity of the metagalactic UV ionizing radiation background, the radius and/or the co-moving number density of, and the fraction of mass in the form of gas in, the absorbers. The data for both the Lyman limit systems and the C IV systems have been fitted simultaneously. It seems that the abundance of carbon has possibly increased by about a factor of 5 to 20 from the cosmic time corresponding to the redshift ‚âÉ 4 to 2. The data also suggest that either the radius or the co-moving number density of the galaxies increased with redshift up to ùëß = 2.0 and decreased slowly thereafter. The total mass of the halo gas was higher in the past, almost equal to the entire mass of the galaxy at ùëß = 4. The hydrogen column density distribution for Lyman limit systems predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed distribution.</p>

					<p>In this paper, the analytical and numerical results of the stability analysis of the accretion disk at the inner boundary is presented. Including the effect of finite conductivity in the  disk dynamics, a simple calculation considering only the radial perturbation has been carried out. Within local approximation, it is concluded that the disk is stable to Kelvin-Helmholtz and resistive electromagnetic modes whereas the magnetosonic mode can destabilise the disk structure.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The straight arc in the galaxy-cluster Abell 2390 is investigated in the framework of a gravitational lens model that invokes a single background source galaxy. An extended source galaxy at a redshift of 0¬∑913 is being marginally lensed by the foreground X-ray cluster of galaxies  at a redshift of 0¬∑231. It is demonstrated that a single lensed galaxy lying on or very near to the lip caustic of the cluster lens is capable of reproducing the linear morphology with the observed breaks.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The observed infrared excess in Be stars is usually interpreted as free-free and free-bound emission from a hot gas envelope around the Be star. This hot gas should also emit Œó-alpha line radiation. Earlier observations had suggested that the infrared excess and HŒ± radiation were not consistent with models in which they arise from the same ionized region; however the observations were made at different times. We have made simultaneous observation of infrared and Œó-alpha line radiation. Our observations imply that either both these radiations cannot arise from the same hot gas or additional processes have to be invoked to account for the observed excess infrared radiation.</p>

					<p>It is sometimes suggested that the change from the horizontal to the normal branch in the X-ray intensity-hardness ratio diagram of low mass X-ray binaries, is due to a change from a thin to a thick disk. It is shown here that wind from the hot thick disk depletes the amount of matter reaching the neutron star, thus causing the observed reduction of X-ray intensity as hardness ratio decreases in the normal branch.</p>

				<title>An Upper Limit to Coronal X-rays from Single, Magnetic White Dwarfs</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Pointed ROSAT PSPC exposures of 9277 and 6992 sec, directed toward the nearby, single, cool, magnetic white dwarfs GR 290 and EG 250 yielded no counts significantly above the expected background rate. The corresponding flux limits (for an assumed source temperature of l keV) are 1.0 and 1.7 √ó 10<sup>-14</sup> erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, within the 0.1‚Äì2.5 keV bandpass of the instrument (99% confidence limits). This is more than an order of magnitude below the tentative detection level (for GR 290) and limits (for four other similar stars) obtained from archival Einstein data in 1991. The corresponding limits on coronal electron density are comparable with those implied if cyclotron emission is not responsible for any of the features observed in the optical spectra of magnetic white dwarfs. X-ray data currently provide no evidence for the existence of coronae around these stars. A final long observation (25,000 sec of GD 356) is scheduled for later this year on ROSAT, along with coordinated EUVE observations.</p>

				<title>A Revised DDO Abundance Calibration for Population I Red Giants</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0145-0165</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Several arguments that justify establishing a revised abundance calibration for DDO photometry of population I red giants are presented. The components of the blanketing vector in the DDO ùê∂(45‚Äì48) vs ùê∂(42‚Äì45) diagram are determined for late-type dwarfs and giants. We have redefined the DDO cyanogen anomaly and calibrated it against metallicity. The sample of field giants now available with abundances derived from high dispersion spectroscopy is substantially larger than previously available, leading to a more accurate abundance calibration. Iso-abundance lines in the ùê∂(41‚Äì42) vs ùê∂(42‚Äì45) diagram have been determined for population IG and Œö giants and an iterative method for deriving abundances of these stars is described. We show that the new DDO abundances are in very good agreement with those derived from high dispersion spectroscopy. The new method improves by about 0.1 dex the DDO abundances derived for early G and/or late Œö giants, with respect to the Œ¥CN method of Janes (1975)</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A two-dimensional instability analysis for a magneto-keplerian disk flow around a compact object is presented here. Using the eigenvalue technique, lenearly coupled perturbed equations have been numerically solved within the local approximation. It is concluded that Kelvin-Helmholtz, magnetosonic (fast and slow) and resistive electromagnetic modes exist. However, only the magnetosonic mode can destabilise the disk structure. Further, we discuss the properties of different modes as a function of disk parameters and plot the eigenmode structures for different physical quantities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A brief account is given of the early development of a new  technique, intensity interferometry, to measure the angular size of radio sources. Following the chance discovery that it was unaffected by scintillation it was proposed to apply the same principle to measuring visible stars. This proposal met with vigorous opposition from physicists when it was realised that it implied that the time of arrival of photons in two mutually coherent beams of light must be correlated. Two laboratory experiments were done to demonstrate that this correlation does in fact take place. Then, after a pilot model had measured the angular size of Sirius, a full scale stellar intensity interferometer was built and installed at Narrabri in Australia. In a programme lasting 12 years it measured the angular diameters of 32 single stars in the spectral range Œü to F and established the first wholly empirical temperature scale for stars in that range. For the last 10 years the work has been continued by the  construction of the larger and more sensitive Sydney University Stellar Interferometer called SUSI.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This review presents a selection of recent highlights of observations of R Coronae Borealis variables. Emphasis is placed on an abundance analysis of a complete sample (18 stars) of the warm galactic RCBs. It is shown that 14 of the 18 have very similar compositions: the  iron mass fraction ranges about a factor of 3 around the solar value (assuming C/He = 3%) but abundance ratios X/Fe for elements from Na to Ba show little variation. By contrast, the other 4 stars are deficient in iron but not in Na, Si, S and some other elements. With for example, [Si/Fe] ‚âÉ 2, the quartet is indeed ‚Äòpeculiar‚Äô. One of the quartet, V854 Cen shows depletions of elements (other than CNO) similar to the depletions seen in interstellar medium corresponding to average log ùëõ(ùêª<sub>tot</sub>) = ‚Äì 1.5. Scenarios for creating RCB from normal single and double stars are summarised.</p>

					<p>We have looked for and found a possible spatial correlation between the present pulsar distribution and the estimated locations of the  spiral arms at earlier epochs. Through a detailed statistical analysis we find a significant correlation between the present distribution of pulsars and the mass distribution (in the spiral arms) expected about 60 Myr ago for a corotation resonance radius of 14kpc. We discuss the implications of this correlation for the minimum mass of the progenitors of pulsars. Interpreting the spread in the locations of pulsars with respect to the past locations of the spiral arms as predominantly due to their space velocities, we derive an average velocity for the pulsar population.</p>

				<title>Observations of Enhanced Sub-Iron (Sc‚ÄìCr) to Iron Abundance Ratios in the Low Energy Galactic Cosmic Rays in Spacelab-3 and their Implications</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0085-0094</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Anuradha cosmic ray experiment in Spacelab-3, flown in the orbit at 350 km with an inclination of 57¬∞ for about six days, was used to measure the low energy galactic cosmic ray (GCR) heavy ions using a specially designed CR-39 detector module incorporating the arrival time information of the particles. The abundances of sub-iron (Sc‚ÄìCr) and iron particles in the low energy interval of 30‚Äì300 MeV/N were determined from the measurements made in four different depths of the CR-39 detector module of 150 layers. From these studies we obtained sub-iron (Sc‚ÄìCr) to iron abundance ratios of 0¬∑8 to 1¬∑2 in 30‚Äì300 MeV/N energy range. It is found that these ratios are enhanced by a factor of two as compared to interplanetary ratios of about 0¬∑5. It is shown that the enhancement of the ratio inside the earth's magnetosphere is probably due to the degree of ionization of low energy Sc to Cr and Fe ions in the galactic cosmic rays and to the rigidity filtering effects of the geomagnetic field. Further studies are needed to understand fully the phenomena and their implications.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0143-0156</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>An attempt is made to infer the structure of the solar convection zone from observed ùëù-mode frequencies of solar oscillations. The differential asymptotic inversion technique is used to find the sound speed in the solar envelope. It is found that envelope models which use the Canuto-Mazzitelli (CM) formulation for calculating the convective flux give significantly better agreement with observations than models constructed using the mixing length formalism. This inference can be drawn from both the scaled frequency differences and the sound speed difference. The sound speed in the CM envelope model is within 0.2% of that in the Sun except in the region with ùëü > 0.99ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub>. The envelope models are extended below the convection zone, to find some evidence for the gravitational settling of helium beneath the base of the convection zone. It turns out that for models with a steep composition gradient below the convection zone, the convection zone depth has to be increased by about 6 Mm in order to get agreement with helioseismic observations.</p>

				<title>Observations of the Bright-rimmed Molecular Clouds near the Cepheus OB2 Association </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0157-0163</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Massive stars have significant influence on the evolution of the interstellar medium. Bright rims, cometary morphology of clouds, as well as their motion are some examples of the influence of massive stars on nearby molecular clouds. The cometary clouds in the Gum-Vela region are very good examples. In an attempt to understand the kinematics of the clouds in such regions we have carried out CO line observations towards bright-rimmed clouds near the OB Association Cep OB2. The radial velocities of the clouds are consistent with an expansion of the system at ‚âà 4kms<sup>-1</sup> away from the dominant O6.5V star in the association, HD206267. We find the rocket mechanism to be the most likely cause for expansion as found for both the Gum-Vela and the Rosette globules. We conclude that such expanding motions are quite common in regions near massive stars and make a brief comparison of the Cepheus system with the Gum-Vela system</p>

				<title>Orbital Elements and Evolutionary Nature of the Long Period RS CVn Type Eclipsing Binary RZ Eridani </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0165-0178</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Light curves of the long period RS CVn type eclipsing binary RZ Eri, obtained during the period 1976‚Äì1979 with the 1.2 m telescope of the Japal‚ÄìRangapur Observatory are analysed, using Wilson‚ÄìDevinney method, by fixing the two parameters ùëá<sub>‚Ñé</sub> (7400¬∞K) and ùëû(0.963), resulting in the following absolute elements: ùê¥ = 72.5 ¬± 1.4 ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub>, ùëÖ<sub>‚Ñé</sub> = 2.84 ¬± 0.12 ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub>, ùëÖ<sub>ùëê</sub> = 6.94 ¬± 0.20 ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub>, ùëÄ<sub>bol, h</sub> = 1.35 ¬± 0.28, ùëÄ<sub>bol, c</sub>= 1.41 ¬± 0.28, ùëö<sub>‚Ñé</sub> = 1.69 ¬± 0.06 ùëö<sub>‚äô</sub> and ùëö<sub>ùëê</sub>= 1.63 ¬± 0.13 ùëö<sub>‚äô</sub>. The presence of humps and dips of varying amplitudes at a few phases in the normal UBV light curves is explained as due to residual distortion wave. The derived (B-V) and (U-B) colours of both the components appear to have been reddened to an extent of 0<sup>ùëö</sup>.20 in (B-V) and 0<sup>ùëö</sup>.16 in (U-B) colours. This reddening is attributed to the presence of an envelope around the system, the material of which might have come from the loss of mass experienced by the evolving cooler component. Taking into consideration the dereddened colours and temperatures of the components, spectral types of ùêπ0 IV for the primary and G 5‚Äì8 III‚ÄìIV for the secondary component were derived. The fractional radii of 0.039 and 0.096 of the two components, when compared with the radii of their critical Roche lobes of 0.378 and 0.372 suggest that these components are well within their critical sizes. From the position of the components on the. isochrones and the evolutionary tracks of stars of Pop I composition computed by Maeder &amp; Meynet, it is concluded that the evolution of the components of RZ Eri is abnormal. This system is found to be situated at a distance of 185 pc, with an age of about 2.5 √ó 10<sup>9</sup>yrs.</p>

				<title>Probable Spectral Steepening of UHE ùõæ-rays of Nuclear Origin and its Consequences </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0179-0186</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent accelerator data based parameterization of the inclusive cross section (ùëê ‚Äì ùë†) for ùúã0 production in hadronic collisions and an explicit incorporation of the finiteness of the relevant projectile hadron spectrum suggest a significant steepening in the spectrum (by as much as 0.4 in the spectral index) of the secondary ùõæ-ray towards the end of the spectrum. We emphasize here that this spectral steepening in conjunction with the possibility that in the bright X-ray binaries the maximum energy to which the ùõæ-ray producing progenitor protons may be accelerated is only ~ 10 PeV, may imply an effective efficiency for ùõæ-ray production, Œµ, as reckoned by the PeV arrays, one or two orders smaller than the previous estimates. To explain the genesis of a given PeV photon flux from an X-ray binary, one, therefore, has to. accordingly consider a much higher value of the progenitor proton beam luminosity, ùêø<sub>ùëù</sub>. This requirement may raise further questions regarding the actual genesis of PeV ùõæ-rays in X-ray binaries, or alternatively, on the veracity of the high values of the PeV photon fluxes reported by earlier experiments.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A radio survey, using the Very Karge Array at 20 and 90cm ùõæ has been carried out in the direction of 46 distant Abell clusters $(0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.3)$ dominated by a cD galaxy (clusters classified to be Bautz-Morgan I type). A radio source coincident with the cD galaxy was detected in 16 clusters. We find that the radio luminosity function of the cD galaxies at 20cm ùõæ, and below the luminosity ùëÉ<sub>1.4GHz</sub> ‚â≤ 10<sup>24¬∑5</sup> W Hz<sup>-1</sup>, is similar to that of brightest ellipticals in less clustered environments. Above this luminosity, the cDs seem to have a higher probability of becoming radio sources. The effect of optical brightness on radio emission is shown to be the same for the two classes. No significantly large population of very steep-spectrum sources with spectral index Œ± > 1.2 (flux density ‚àù frequency<sup>-Œ±</sup>) was found to be associated with cD galaxies. A significant negative correlation is found between the radio luminosity of the cD galaxy and the cooling-time of the intra cluster medium near the galaxy. We also present evidence that the probability of radio emission from first-ranked galaxies is dependent upon their location relative to the geometrical centres of clusters and thus related to the morphological class and the evolutionary state of the clusters. We argue that both these effects are primarily caused by the dynamical evolution of these distant clusters of galaxies.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Hd 163621 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary in a circular orbit whose period is 3.3 days. Spectral classification of the components has proved difficult, but current results of K0 V and late Œö V are reasonably consistent with our best model of the system, which has spectral types of G8V and K7V. The object shows photometric variability and chromospheric activity and is therefore a member of the BY Draconis class of variables. The minimum masses are quite small, 0.10 and 0.07 ùëÄ<sub>‚äô</sub> for the primary and secondary, respectively, suggesting an orbital inclination of about 30¬∞. The system is synchronously rotating. Its distance is estimated to be 31 pc, which makes it an excellent candidate for a trigonometric parallax determination.</p>

				<title>Radio Synthesis Imaging of Anisotropic Angular Broadening in the Solar Wind</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0387-0414</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present Very Large Array observations at wavelengths of 2, 3.5, 6, and 20 cm, of angular broadening of radio sources due to the solar wind in the region 2‚Äì16 solar radii. Angular broadening is anisotropic with axial ratios in the range 2‚Äì16. Larger axial ratios are observed preferentially at smaller solar distances. Assuming that anisotropy is due to scattering blobs elongated along magnetic field lines, the distribution of position angles of the elliptically broadened images indicates that the field lines are non-radial even at the largest heliocentric distances observed here. At 5ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub>, the major axis scattering angle is ~ 0.7" at ùúÜ= 6 cm and it varies with heliocentric distance as ùëÖ<sup>-1.6</sup>. The level of turbulence, characterized by the wave structure function at a scale of 10 km along the major axis, normalized to ùúÜ = 20 cm, has a value 20 ¬± 7 at 5ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub> and varies with heliocentric distance as ùëÖ<sup>-3</sup>. Comparison with earlier resu lts suggest that the level of turbulence is higher during solar maximum. Assuming a power-law spectrum of electron density fluctuations, the fitted spectral exponents have values in the range 2.8‚Äì3.4 for scale sizes between 2‚Äì35 km. The data suggests temporal fluctuations (of up to 10%) in the spectral exponent on a time scale of a few tens of minutes. The observed structure functions at different solar distances do not show any evidence for an inner scale; the upper limits are 1 km at 2 ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub> and 4 km at 13 ùëÖ<sub>‚äô</sub>. These upper limits are in conflict with earlier determinations and may suggest a reduced inner scale during solar maximum.</p>

				<title>A Study of the Kinematics of the Local Dark Clouds</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0415-0443</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Lack of reliable estimates of distances to most of the local dark clouds has, so far, prevented a quantitative study of their kinematics. Using a statistical approach, we have been able to extract the average spatial distribution as well as the kinematical behaviour of the local dark clouds from their measured radial velocities. For this purpose, we have obtained radial velocities for 115 southern clouds and used the data from the literature for the northern ones. In this paper we present this new data, analyse the combined data and compare our results with those arrived at by earlier studies.</p>
					<p>The local clouds are found to be expanding at a speed of ~ 4 kms<sup>-1</sup> which is in general agreement  with the estimates from optical and HI studies. However, it is found that the kinematics of the local clouds is not described by the model proposed for the local HI gas where a ring of gas expanding from a point gets sheared by the galactic rotation. Rather, the observed distribution of their radial velocities is best understood in terms of a model in which the local clouds are participating in circular rotation appropriate to their present positions with a small expansion also superimposed. This possibly implies that cloud-cloud collisions are important. The spatial distribution of clouds derived using such a model is in good agreement with the local dust distribution obtained from measurements of reddening and extinction towards nearby stars. In particular, a region of size ~ 350 pc in diameter enclosing the Sun is found to be devoid of clouds. Intriguingly, most clouds in the longitude range 100¬∞ to 145¬∞ appear to have negative radial celocities implying that they are approaching us.</p>

					<p>Radio maps at 5 GHz with an angular resolution of 1 to 2 arcsec and a dynamic range $\gtrsim 200:1$ are presented for a sample of 45 radio quasars at redshifts between 0.2 and 1.5. The sources were imaged from observations made with the Very Large Array with the aim of investigating the epoch dependence of misalignments and asymmetries in their extended radio structure. Maps of some of the larger radio sources are presented also at a frequency of 1.5 GHz with a typical angular resolution of ~ 4 arcsec. The radio structure of most of the quasars reported here has been delineated in considerably greater detail than available in the literature.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We present velocity observations, obtained with the E. W. Fick Observatory 0.6 m telescope, of the 7th magnitude ùêæ1 star HR 7112. Our observations show that HR 7112 is a double-line spectroscopic binary system composed of almost equal mass stars with a period of 215.6 days. The orbit has an eccentricity ùëí = 0.142 and the stars orbit each other with a mean semi-major axis distance of approximately 0.4sin(i) AU. The masses of the stars are consistent with the classification as giant stars. Tidal effects are known to circularise the orbits of giant stars and this process is apparently underway in this system.</p>

				<title>Pulsar Velocities</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0097-0106</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Radio pulsars have long been established as having high velocities that are probably produced in the violence of their formation in Supernovae (Gunn &amp; Ostriker 1970; Lyne, Anderson &amp; Salter 1982). Three recent developments have resulted in a reassessment oftheir velocities: the adoption of a new distance scale (Taylor &amp; Cordes 1993), many new determinations of proper motion (Harrison, Lyne &amp; Anderson 1993; Bailes et al. 1992) and the realisation (Harrison &amp; Lyne 1993) that estimates of speeds derived from scintillation measurements were systematically low by about a factor of 2. Taking into account a strong selection effect that makes the observed velocities unrepresentative of those acquired at birth, it seems that the mean space velocity of pulsars at birth is 450 ¬± 90 km s<sub>-1</sub> (Lyne and Lorimer 1994), about a factor of 3 greater than earlier estimates. The general migration from the Galactic plane is consistent with birth in the supernova of massive population I stars. An outstanding question is how such velocities are produced in the kinetics of supernova collapse. This large increase in birth velocity is likely to have a major impact upon our understanding of the retention of neutron stars in binary systems, globular clusters and the Galaxy as it exceeds or is comparable with all their escape velocities. The rapid spatial separation of fast and slow pulsars will have a profound effect upon calculations of the galactic population and birth rate, both of which have been underestimated in the past. Furthermore, the distribution of dead neutron stars will be more isotropic and may better match the distribution of the gamma-ray burst sources. A small number of pulsars are at a large distance from the Galactic plane, but moving towards it. The most likely origin of these objects lies in OB runaway stars.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Observations of mean or average pulse profiles and their polarization give us much information on the shape of pulsar beams. The observed polarization variations, profile symmetry and frequency dependence of profile shape strongly suggest that the emission beam is conical and emitted from the vicinity of a magnetic pole. Central and outer parts of the beam have somewhat different properties, but the evidence is that they are emitted by the same basic mechanism. Recent observations suggest that the highly polarized pulse components seen in young pulsars may be emitted at a large angle to the magnetic axis</p>

				<title>Magnetospheric Models of Pulsars‚ÄìOutstanding Questions </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0119-0135</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The difficulties of the pulsar magnetosphere problem are illustrated by two models for the axisymmetric magnetic rotator: (a) a classical model, in which the return current problem is linked with angular momentum dissipation through incoherent gamma radiation beyond the light-cylinder; and (b) a quantum model, in which electronpositron pairs are produced near the star, and spin-down is primarily through the transport of angular momentum by an e+ - e- wind. The first model has some pedagogic value, but it makes the embarrassing prediction that all the spin-down energy is emitted as gammaradiation. In the second model a predicted small but significant emission in gamma- and X-rays is again linked with the return current problem, but the bulk of the energy emission is through the wind. The presence of both a high-ùõæ pair plasma is a required by most models of coherent microwave emission. Problems persist in ensuring that the macroscopic conditions on the electric field are locally consistent with the microphysics. The most promising picture is of a spontaneous local hydromagnetic instability that yields a large effective resistivity. Some remarks are made on future extension of the theory to oblique geometry. For agreement with observations of the Crab nebula, the predicted dominance in the wind of the Poynting flux must be reversed in the far magnetosphere.</p>

				<title>The Models for Radio Emission from Pulsars ‚Äì The Outstanding issues</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0137-0164</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The theory of pulsar radio emission is reviewed critically, emphasizing reasons why there is no single, widely-accepted emission mechanism. The uncertainties in our understanding of how the magnetosphere is populated with plasma preclude predicting the properties of the emission from first principles. Some important observational features are incorporated into virtually all the proposed emission mechanisms, and other observational features are either controversial or fail to provide criteria that clearly favor one mechanism over others. It is suggested that the criterion that the emission mechanism apply to millisecond, fast yound, and slow pulsars implies that it is insensitive to the magnetic field strength.</p>
					<p>It is argued that coherent emission processes in all astrophysical and space plasmas consist of emission from many localized, transient subsources, that any theory requires both an emission mechanism and a statistical theory for the subsource, and, that this aspect of coherent emission has been largely ignored in treatments of pulsar radio emission. Several specific proposed emission mechanisms are discussed critically: coherent curvature emission by bunches, relativistic plasma emission, maser curvature emission, cyclotron instability and free electron maser emission. It is suggested that some form of relativistic plasma emission is the most plausible candidate although one form of maser curvature emission and free electron maser emission are not ruledout. Propagation effects are discussed, emphasizing the interpretation of jumps between orthogonal polarizations.</p>

				<page>0165-0171</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Two investigations of millisecond pulsar radiation are discussed: average total intensity pulse morphology and individual pulse to pulse fluctuations. The average emission profiles of millisecond pulsars are compared with those of slower pulsars in the context of polar cap models. In general the full widths of pulsar emission regions continue to widen inversely with priod ùëÉ<sup>-(0.30-0.5)</sup> as expected for dipole polar cap models. Many pulse components are very narrow. The period scaling of pulsar profiles ‚Äì separations and widths ‚Äì can tell us about the angular distribution of radiating currents. An investigation of individual pulses from two millisecond pulsars at 430 MHz shows erratic pulse to pulse variations similar to that seen in slow pulsars. PSR Œí1937+21 displays occasional strong pulses that are located in the trailing edge of the average profile with relative flux densities in the range of 100 to 400. These are similar to the giant pulses seen in the Crab pulsar.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0179-0190</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the most remarkable properties of radio pulsars is their rotational stability which allows many uses as clocks, For instance they enable us to determine the shapes and sizes of binary orbits, to study general relativistic effects in strong gravitational fields, to demonstrate the existance of gravitational radiation from binary systems, to permit the detection of extra solar planets, and also to put limits on the long period gravitational wave background. However, some display timing imperfections which tell us about the insides of neutron stars. This review describes the basic physics of slowdown and how period instabilities seem to be related to the rate of slowdown and the presence of internal superfluid liquid. Careful studies of glitches and the subsequent rotational behaviour of the pulsars can provide valuable information on the internal structure of neutron stars.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0191-0206</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is shown that if neutron stars contain dynamically decoupled components, most plausibly discrete superfluid zones, then it is possible for the spin axes of these components o become slightly misaligned with respect to the crustal spin following a series of glitches. The crust will then undergo Lese-Thirring precession about the total angular moment with a period of ~ 6 ‚Äì 7.5 ùëÉ (assuming a crustal superfluid) and ~ 3 ‚Äì 6ùëÉ (if the core superfluid is not tightly coupled to the crust). The precise precessional period is diagnostic of the mass distribution within each component. The implications of recent observational inferences concerning glitching pulsars are discussed. The conditions necessary for precession to be observable are analysed phenomenologically and a search of pulse-timing data for evidence of a Lense-Thirring modulation within the period range ~ 3 ‚Äì 8ùëÉ is proposed.</p>

Observational data indicates that the magnetic field of a neutron star decays significantly only if it has been a member of a close interacting binary. Theoretically, the magnetic field evolution has been related to the processing of a neutron star in a binary system through the spin evolution of the neutron star, and also through the accretion of matter on the neutron star surface. I describe two specific models, one in which magnetic flux is expelled from the superconducting core during spin-down, via a copuling between Abrikosov fluxoids and Onsager-Feynman vortices; and another in which the compression and heating of the stellar crust by the accreted mass drastically reduces the ohmic decay time scale of a magnetic field configuration confined entirely to the crust. General remarks about the behaviour of the crustal field under ohmic diffusion are also made.</p>

				<title>Deep Radio Observations of the Rich Globular Clusters Terzan 5 and Liller 1</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0245-0253</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We have obtained deep 6, 20 and 90 cm observation of two of the richest globular clusters in the galaxy, Terzan 5 and Liller 1. In addition to the well known eclipsing pulsar, PSR1744-24A, our 20 cm image of Terzan 5 displays numerous point sources within 30", or 4 core radii of the cluster center. The density of these objects rises rapidly toward the core, where an elongated region of emission is found. This feature may be due to the presence of a higher density of point sources than can be resolved by the 1" resolution of our data. Observations at 6 and 90 cm show that the brightest individual sources, as well as the extended emission, possess the steep spectra expected of pulsars. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the sources in the 20 cm image agrees well with the standard pulsar luminosity function. The total luminosity and number of objects observed in Terzan 5 suggest that this cluster may contain 100 pulsars ‚Äì probably more than any other Galactic cluster. Although we do not resolve individual sources in Liller 1, comparison of our images with other observations suggests that we are again observing the sum of emission from a number of objects. The 90 cm flux densities of Terzan 5 and Liller 1 are 35 and 9 mJy, respectively, implying that a number of bright pulsars in these clusters have been hidden from pulsed searches, perhaps by a combination of dispersion smearing, scattering and doppler broadening.</p>

				<title>Scenarios for the formation of binary and millisecond pulsars - A Critical assessment</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0255-0288</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The evolution of high-and low-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB and LMXB) into different types of binary radio pulsars, the `high-mass binary pulsars' (HMBP) and `low-mass binary pulsars' (LMBP) is discussed. The HMXB evolve either into Thorne-Zytkow objects or into short-period binaries consisting of a helium star plus a neutron star (or a black hole), resembling Cygnus X-3. The latter systems evolve (with or without a second common-envelope phase) into close binary pulsars, in which the companion of the pulsar may be a massive white dwarf, a neutron star or a black hole (some final systems may also consist of two black holes). A considerable fraction of the systems may also be disrupted in the second supernova explosion. we discuss the possible resons why the observed numbers of double neutron stars and of systems like Cyg X-3 are several orders of magnitude lower than theoretically predicted. It is argued that the observed systems form the tip of an iceberg of much larger populations of unobserved systems, some of which may become observable in the future. As to the LMBP, we consider in some detail the origins of systems with orbital periods in the range 1-20 days. We show that to explain their existence, losses of orbital angular momentum (e.g., by magnetic braking) and in a number of cases: also of mass, have to be taken into account. The masses of the low-mass white dwarf companions in these systems can be predicted accurately. We notice a clear correlation between spin period and orbital period for these systems, as well as a clear correlation between pulsar magnetic field strength and orbital period. These relations strongly suggest that increased amounts of mass accreted by the neutron stars lead to increased decay of their magnetic fields: we suggest a simple way to understand the observed value of the `bottom' field strengths of a few times 10<sup>8</sup> G. Furthermore, we find that the LMBP-systems in which the pulsar has a strong magnetic field (&gt; 1o<sup>11</sup> G) have an about two orders of magnitude larger birth rate (i.e., about 4 √ó 10<sup>-4</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Galaxy) than the systems with millisecond pulsars (which have B &lt; 10<sup>9</sup> G). Using the observational fact that neutron stars reveive a velocity kick of ~450 km/s at birth, we find that some 90% of the potential progenitor systems of the strongfield LMBP must have been disrupted in the Supernovae in which their neutron stars were formed. Hence, the formation rate of the progenitors of the strong-field LMBP is of the same order as the galactic supernova rate (4 √ó 10<sup>-3</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). This implies that a large fraction of all Supernovae take place in binaries with a close low-mass  (&lt; 2.3 M<sub>‚äô</sub>) companion.</p>

				<title>Spin Evolution of Neutron Satars in Binary Systems</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0289-0305</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>I review our understanding of the evolution of the spin periods of neutron stars in binary stellar systems, from their birth as fast, spin-powered pulsars, through their middle life as accretion-powered pulsars, upto their recycling or "rebirth" as spin-powered pulsars with relatively low magnetic fields and fast rotation. I discuss how the new born neutron star is spun down by electromagnetic and "propeller" torques, until accretion of matter from the companion star begins, and the neutron star becomes an accretion-powered X-ray pulsar. Detailed observations of massive radio pulsar binaries like PSR 1259-63 will yield valuable information about this phase of initial spindown. I indicate how the spin of the neutron star then evolves under accretion torques during the subsequent phase as an accretion-powered pulsar. Finally, I describe how the neutron star is recycling, with the accompanying reduction in the stellar magnetic field, the orgins of which are still not completely understood.</p>

				<title>Polarization-Mode Separation and the Emission Geometry of Pulsar 0823 + 26: A New Pattern of Pulsar Emission?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0327-0355</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We explore the detailed polarization behaviour of pulsar 0823 + 26 using the technique of constructing partial ‚Äòmode-separated‚Äô profiles corresponding to the primary and secondary polarization modes. The characteristics of the two polarization modes in this pulsar are particularly interesting, both because they are anything but orthogonal and because the secondary mode exhibits a structure seen neither in the primary mode nor in the total profile. The new leading and trailing features in the secondary mode, which appear to represent a conal component pair, are interpreted geometrically on the basis of their width and the associated polarization-angle traverse as an outer cone.</p>
					<p>If the secondary-mode features are, indeed, an outer cone, then questions about the significance of the pulsar‚Äôs postcursor component become more pressing. It seems that 0823 + 26 has a very nearly equatorial geometry, in that both magnetic poles and the sightline all fall close to the rotational equator of the star. We thus associate the postcursor component with emission along those bundles of field lines which are also equatorial and which continue to have a tangent in the direction of our sight line for a significant portion of the star‚Äôs rotation cycle. It seems that in all pulsars with postcursor components, this emission follows the core component, and all may thus have equatorial emission geometries. No pulsars with precursors in this sense ‚Äì including the Crab pulsar ‚Äì are known.</p>
					<p>The distribution of power between the primary and secondary modes is very similar at both 430 and 1400 MHz. Our analysis shows that in this pulsar considerable depolarization must be occurring on time scales that are short compared to the time resolution of our observations, which is here some 0.5‚Äì1.0 milliseconds. One of the most interesting features of the mode separated partial profiles is a phase offset between the primary and secondary modes. The secondary-mode ‚Äòmain pulse‚Äô arrives some 1.5 ¬± 0.1¬∞ before the primary-mode one at 430 MHz and some 1.3 + 0.1 ¬∞ at 21 cm. Given that the polar cap has an angular diameter of 3.36¬∞, we consider whether this is a geometric effect or an effect of differential propagation of the two modes in the inner magnetosphere of the pulsar.</p>

				<feature></feature>
				<page>0357-0374</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>For accretion on to neutron stars possessing weak surface magnetic fields and substantial rotation rates (corresponding to the secular instability limit), we calculate the disk and surface layer luminosities general relativistically using the Hartle &amp; Thorne formalism, and illustrate these quantities for a set of representative neutron star equations of state. We also discuss the related problem of the angular momentum evolution of such neutron stars and give a quantitative estimate for this accretion driven change in angular momentum. Rotation always increases the disk luminosity and reduces the rate of angular momentum evolution. These effects have relevance for observations of low-mass X-ray binaries.</p>

				<title>Flux Monitoring at 327 MHz during SL9-Jupiter Collision</title>

				<page>0393-0398</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Jupiter flux at 327 MHz was monitored using the Ooty radio telescope from July 12th to July 29th during the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levi 9 with Jupiter. Flux was found to increase steadily from July 17th to July 26th by ~ 2¬∑5 Jy, after which it declined to its pre-event value. The comparison of 327 MHz observations with those at 840 MHz and 2240 MHz indicates that the enhancement was mainly due to the increased synchrotron emission and the contribution of thermal emission was very small at metric-decimetric frequencies. The enhancement in radio emission was found to be more at 840 MHz than at 327 or 2240 MHz. The steepening of the spectrum between 327 and 840 MHz as well as between 2240 and 840 MHz was also noted.</p>

The de-reddened colours obtained from applying the reddening corrections of ùê∏(ùêµ-ùëâ) = 0m.05 and ùê∏(ùëà-ùêµ) = 0<sup>ùëö</sup>.04, and the derived temperatures of the components, gave spectral types of ùêµ1.5ùëâ for the primary and ùêµ4.5ùëâ with an ùëàùëâ excess of 0<sup>ùëö</sup>.03 for the secondary component. A comparison of the log ùêø and log ùëá<sub>ùëí</sub> of the components with the observed ZAMS shows the primary component to be a little above and the secondary component to be a little below/or on the ZAMS. A comparison of the properties of the components of VV Ori and a few other detached systems with the normal stars in the log ùêø, log ùëÖ and log ùëá<sub>ùëí</sub> versus log ùëö planes, indicated a need for either a readjustment of the scales of the above parameters or modifications in the theoretical models. From the position of the components on the evolutionary tracks of Pop I composition computed by Schaller et al. (1992) it is noticed that while the primary component of VV Ori had slightly evolved along the main-sequence, its secondary is still unevolved. The age of VV Ori is found to be 10 ¬± 1 million years and it is at a distance of 368 ¬± 10 pc.</p>

				<title>The Chemical Compositions and Ages of Globular Clusters</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0006</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Recent technological advances have led to a dramatic improvement in the quality of photometric and spectroscopic data obtainable on stars in globular clusters. Evidence from CCD-based colour magnitude diagrams points to clear differences in age between some clusters. High dispersion spectra show that abundance variations cannot explain the observed differences. In particular, it seems that NGC 288 must be 2‚Äì3 Gyr older than NGC 362. The same spectra show that although there is a spread in some molecular band strengths in NGC 362, the total C+N+O abundance remains constant, indicating that the material has undergone varying amounts of nuclear processing. No variations are seen in the abundances of iron group elements. Lower dispersion spectra for a large sample of faint stars in 47 Tucanae, obtained with a multi-object optical fibre system, show that unevolved main sequence stars in that cluster share the same CNO variations as the bright giants. The conclusion from all these data is that the intra-cluster CNO variations are neither truly primordial nor due to evolutionary mixing. It may be that there was a sufficiently extended period of star formation for material from first generation stars to be used in later generations, or that some pollution has occurred due to mass loss. Finally, it is noted that if ‚Äòprehistoric‚Äô clusters exist with ages of around 50 Gyr, as hypothesised in some cosmological models, these should probably still be rather obvious and readily recognised.</p>

				<title>Application of ‚ÄòCLEAN‚Äô in the Power Spectral Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Pulsar Timing Data</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0007-0016</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Spectral analysis of the residual pulsearrival times of pulsars is a useful tool in understanding the nature of the underlying processes that may be responsible for the timing noise observed from pulsars. Power spectra of pulsar timing residuals may be described by one or a combination of powerlaws. As these spectra are expected to be very steep, it is important to ensure a high dynamic range in the estimation of the spectrum. This is difficult in practice since one is, in general, dealing with timing measurements made at unevenly placed epochs. In this paper, we present a technique based on, ‚ÄòCLEAN‚Äô to obtain high dynamic range spectra from unevenly sampled data. We compare the performance of this technique with other techniques including some that were used earlier for estimation of power spectra of pulsar timing residuals.</p>

				<title>Limits on the Chirality of Interstellar and Intergalactic Space</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0017-0021</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We raise the question of whether velocities of left and right circularly-polarized photons might be different (for reasons other than the well-known Faraday effect). Such a difference could manifest itself either in the time profiles of pulsed or bursting astronomical sources or in the rotation of the direction of polarization of linearly polarized radiation from them. The existing observations of pulsars, gamma ray bursters, and quasar jets are used to set limits to the difference in speed, |ùëê(ùêø) ‚Äì ùëê(ùëÖ)|/ ùëê between 10<sup>-17</sup> and 10<sup>-32</sup>.</p>

				<page>0113-0145</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The negative ion of hydrogen continues to be important in atomic physics and astrophysics. Correlations between the two electrons are strong already in the ground state, the only bound state in this three-body system. This state attracted early interest, especially for the description of stellar atmospheres by Chandrasekhar and others. More recently, the rich spectrum of doubly-excited states, and the nature of the double escape above the break-up energy of 14.35 eV, have been central to our understanding of highly-correlated, non-separable problems in quantum physics. This article is a survey of the story of H‚Äì as it has developed over the last seventy years.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Power spectra of the timing noise observed in 18 southern pulsars have been derived using a novel technique, based on the CLEAN algorithm. Most of the spectra are well described by a single-or Double-component power-law model. Some of these spectra can be interpreted in the context of one or more of the current timing noise models. The results combined with those obtained from the time-domain analyses of the timing activity in these pulsars are used to assess the viability of the various theoretical models of pulsar timing noise.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>we suggest that the dynamical regime(s) underlying quasiperiodic oscillations observed in the spectra of bright galactic-bulge X-ray sources are nonlinear with a mixed phase space. The important feature of such regimes is that they are generic among nonlinear Hamiltonian and nearly Hamiltonian systems of more than two degrees of freedom. We give a simple example of such chaotic (deterministic) systems whose spectra share a number of features with those observed for quasiperiodic oscillations of such sources.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Super-active region NOAA 6555 was highly flare productive during the period March 21st ‚Äì 27th, 1991 of its disk passage. We have studied its chromospheric activity using high spatial resolution HŒ± filtergrams taken at Udaipur along with MSFC vector magnetograms. A possible relationship of flare productivity and the variation in shear has been explored. Flares were generally seen in those subareas of the active region which possessed closed magnetic field configuration, whereas only minor flares and/or surges occurred in subareas showing open magnetic field configuration. Physical mechanisms responsible for the observed surges are also discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The energy and angular distribution of electrons as a function of column densities initially for monoenergetic and monodirectional electron beams and incidence angles of 0¬∞, 30¬∞ and 60¬∞ have been studied by combining small angle scattering using analytical treatment with large angle collisions using Monte Carlo calculations. Using these distributions, X-ray and EUV-line flux have been studied as a function of column density. It is observed that the line flux increases with the increase in column density, becoming significant at intermediate column densities where the electron energies and angular distributions have a non maxwellian nature.</p>

				<title>Ejections of Population IIŒô Objects Seen as Blueshifted QSOs?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0073-0085</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We discuss the origin of the optical jets and the apparently associated cloud of QSOs in NGC 1097. There is a simple explanation for the jets in terms of ejection trails of supermassive black holes. In this interpretation, the trails provide the first direct evidence for the nonconservation of linear momentum in a two black hole collision. The cluster of quasars at the end of the jets is then naturally associated with objects which have been ejected by the merging pair of black holes. It is possible to interpret the spectral lines of these QSOs such that half of them are blueshifted relative to NGC 1097 while the other half is redshifted. We infer that the objects in the QSO cluster are not real QSOs but probably collapsed objects of lower mass. We argue that these objects are likely to represent the hypothetical population III black holes of Carr <i>et al</i>.</p>

				<title>On the Polarisation and Emission Geometry of Pulsar 1929+10: Does Its Emission Come from a Single Pole or Two Poles?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0091-0131</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Pulsar Œí1929+10 is remarkable on a number of grounds. Its narrow primary components exhibit virtually complete and highly stable linear polarisation, which can be detected over most of its rotation cycle. Various workers have been lured by the unprecedented range over which its linear polarisation angle can be determined, and more attempts have been made to model its emission geometry than perhaps for any other pulsar. Paradoxically, there is compelling evidence to interpret the pulsar's emission geometry <i>both</i> in terms of an aligned configuration whereby its observed radiation comes from a single magnetic-polar emission region <i>and</i> in terms of a nearly orthogonal configuration in which we receive emission from regions near each of its two poles. Pulsar 1929+10 thus provides a fascinating context in which to probe the conflict between these lines of interpretation in an effort to deepen our understanding of pulsar radio emission</p>
					<p>Least-squares fits to the polarisation-angle traverse fit poorly near the main pulse and interpulse and have an inflection point far from the centre of the main pulse. This and a number of other circumstances suggest that the position-angle traverse is an unreliable indicator of the geometry in this pulsar, possibly in part because its low level 'pedestal' emission makes it impossible to properly calibrate a Polarimeter which correlates orthogonal circular polarisations.</p>
					<p>Taking the interpulse and main-pulse comp. II widths as indicators of the magnetic latitude, it appears that pulsar 1929+10 has an Œ± value near 90¬∞ and thus has a two-pole interpulse geometry. This line of  interpretation leads to interesting and consistent results regarding the geometry of the conal components. Features corresponding to both an inner and outer cone are identified. In addition, it appears that pulsar 1929+10‚Äîand a few other stars‚Äîhave what we are forced to identify as a 'furtherin' cone, with a conal emission radius of about $2.3^\circ/P^{\frac{1}{2}}$.</p>
					<p>Secondarily, 1929+10's nearly complete linear polarisation provides an ideal opportunity to study how mechanisms of depolarisation function on a pulse-to-pulse basis. Secondary-polarisation-mode emission appears in significant proportion only in some limited ranges of longitude, and the subsequent depolarization is studied using different mode-separation techniques. The characteristics of the two polarisation modes are particularly interesting, both because the primary mode usually dominates the secondary so completely and because the structure seen in the secondary mode appears to bear importantly on the question of the pulsar's basic emission geometry. New secondary-mode features are detected in the average profile of this pulsar which appear independent of the main-pulse component structure and which apparently constitute displaced modal emission.</p>
					<p>Individual pulses during which the secondary-mode dominates the primary one are found to be considerably more intense than the others and largely depolarised. Monte-Carlo modeling of the mode mixing in this region, near the boundary of comps. II and III, indicates that the incoherent interference of two fully and orthogonally polarised modes can adequately account for the observed depolarisation. The amplitude distributions of the two polarisation modes are both quite steady: the primary polarisation mode is well fitted by a œá<sup>2</sup> distribution with about nine degrees of freedom; whereas the secondary mode requires a more intense distribution which is constant, but sporadic.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have performed proximity effect analysis of low and high resolution data, considering detailed frequency and redshift dependence of the AGN spectra processed through galactic and intergalactic material. We show that such a background flux, calculated using the observed distribution of AGNs, falls short of the value required by the proximity effect analysis by a factor of ‚â• 2.7. We have studied the uncertainty in the value of the required flux due to its dependence on the resolution, description of column density distribution, systemic redshifts of QSOs etc. We conclude that in view of these uncertainties the proximity effect is consistent with the background contributed by the observed AGNs and that the hypothesized presence of an additional, dust extinct, population of AGNs may not be necessary.</p>

Four abundance groups exhibit characteristics which imply association with, respectively, the thick disk, old thin disk, and Roman's "4140" group.

				<title>MBR as the Relic of Big Bang</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0231-0240</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In this talk I outline some of the arguments in support of a cosmological and primordial origin of the observed microwave background radiation (MBR) in the early hot phase of the unicerse. This interpretation of the MBR is at the heart of the hot Big Bang model (HBBM) of the universe. The observed Planckian energy distribution of the microwave photons reflects the thermal equilibrium that can be set up naturally within HBBM in the dense early universe. Alternate interpretations face the challenge of extremely tight constraints on deviations from a Planckian distribution. Within HBBM, the formation of large scale structure is linked to tiny anisotropies in the angular distribution of the MBR photons. Recent measurements of these anisotropies seem to be broadly consistent with the predictions of the current scenarios of structure formation in the universe. Since these predictions are based on HBBM, the concurrence of data with theory provides additional support in favour of viewing the MBR as the relic of Big Bang.</p>

				<title>Evidence for Evolution as Support for Big Bang</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0241-0249</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>With the exception of ZERO, the concept of BIG BANG is by far the most bizarre creation of the human mind. Three classical pillars of  the Big Bang model of the origin of the universe are generally thought to be: (i) The abundances of the light elements; (ii) the microwave background radiation; and (iii) the change with cosmic epoch in the average properties of galaxies (both active and non-active types). Evidence is also mounting for redshift dependence of the intergalactic medium, as discussed elsewhere in this volume in detail. In this contribution, I endeavour to highlight a selection of recent advances pertaining to the third category.</p>
					<p>The Widely different levels of confidence in the claimed observational constraints in the field of cosmology can be guaged from the following excerpts from two leading astrophysicists:</p>
					<p><i>‚ÄúI would bet odds of 10 to 1 on the validity of the general ‚Äòhot Big Bang‚Äô  concept as a description of how our universe has evolved since it was around 1 sec. old‚Äù</i> ‚ÄîM. Rees (1995), in ‚ÄòPerspectives in Astrophysical Cosmology‚Äô CUP.</p>
					<p><i>‚ÄúWith the much more sensitive observations available today, no astrophysical property shows evidence of evolution, such as was claimed in the 1950s to disprove the Steady State theory‚Äù</i> ‚ÄîF. Hoyle (1987), in ‚ÄòFifty years in cosmology‚Äô, B.M. Birla Memorial Lecture, Hyderabad, India.</p>
					<p>The burgeoning multi-wavelength culture in astronomy has provided a tremendous boost to observational cosmology in recent years. We now proceed to illustrate this with a sequence of examples which reinforce the picture of an evolving universe. Also provided are some relevant details of the data used in these studies so that their scope can be independently judged by the readers.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The discovery of the 3 K microwave background radiation (MBR) and its interpretation as a relict of the hot big bang was probably the most important observation that led to the elevation of the hot big bank model to the status of a `Standard Model'. The temperature of this background is consistant with the primordial nucleosynthesis hypothesis. Detailed measurements of the spectrum and angular anisotropy of this radiation background have been found ‚Äì within the measurement errors ‚Äìto be consistent with the expectations of the Standard Model and with the formation of structure from the gravitational growth of primordial seed density perturbations within this framework.</p>

					<p>The fundamental properties of Friedmann Universes, which  are attractive because of their simplicity, are linear expansion (except for deceleration), cooling, and evolution. In addition it is assumed that the fundamental constants of physics are constant and that the known laws of physics apply (including GR). An increasing number of observational tests support these premises. In particular the expansion is as linear as can be tested. The present expansion rate (ùêª<sub>0</sub> = 55 ¬± 10 km s<sup>-1</sup> Mpc<sub>-1</sub>) implies an expansion age of 17.8 ¬± 3.2 Gyr (for ùëû<sub>0</sub> = 0) to 11.9 ¬± 2.1 Gyr (for ùëû<sub>0</sub> = 1/2). This agrees perfectly within the errors, even for a critical Universe, with present age determinations of the oldest objects in the Galaxy which require 13.5 ¬± 2 Gyr.</p>

				<title>Constraints on Big Bang Models from Structure Formation</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0303-0311</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>I review the constraints on standard big bang model arising from considerations related to structure formation. I will focus on two specific series of models though similar analysis can be performed for a wider class of models. The first one is a ‚Ñ¶ = 1 model with non-zero cosmological constant and the second one is a ‚Ñ¶ &lt; 1 model with zero cosmological constant. The observational constraints which I shall discuss include the measurement of the Hubble‚Äôs constant, the ages of globular clusters, the abundance of rich clusters, the baryon content of galaxy clusters and the abundance of high redshift objects. These constraints limit the allowed range of the cosmological parameters and allow. for only a small region to survive. In particular, the aesthetically pleasing model with ‚Ñ¶ = 1 and zero cosmological constant is ruled out by the observations. It seems necessary to fine-tune the theoretical parameters if they have to fall within the available space. This talk is based on the work in Bagla <i>et al</i>. (1996).</p>

					<p>Still more shocking than the metaphysical assumption of some initial singularity, is the constant insistence upon the so-called cosmological principle of ‚Äúhomogeneity‚Äù and ‚Äúisotropy‚Äù of the Universe. Observations do contradict this principle. And to me, the inhomogeneous, fractal at least on a certain scale range, of the distribution of matter is in itself an important cosmological fact, hitherto almost neglected. Moreover difficulties as to the applicability of the second principle of thermodynamics, observations of abnormal redshifts, etc., are casting large doubts not only upon the standard cosmological models, but even on the interpretation of the observed redshift as due solely to a universal expansion.</p>

For large t anisotropy in pressure and heat flux tend to vanish leading to a perfect fluid. There is a free function of time in the model, which can be suitably chosen for non singular behaviour and there exist multiplicity of such choices.</p>

				<title>Absence of Initial Singularities in Superstring Cosmology</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0363-0379</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>In a universe whose elementary constituents are point particles there does not seem to be any obvious mechanism for avoiding the initial singularities in physical quantities in the standard model of cosmology. In contrast in string theory these singularities can be absent even at the level where spacetime is treated classically. This is a consequence of the basic degrees of freedom of strings in compact spaces, which necessitate a reinterpretation of what one means by a very small universe. We discuss the basic degrees of freedom of a string at the classical and quantum level, the minimum size of strings(string uncertainty principle), the ùë° duality symmetry, and string thermodynamics at high energy densities, and then describe how these considerations suggest a resolution of the initial singularity problem. An effort has been made to keep this writeup self-contained and accessible to non-string theorists.</p>

					<p>We briefly review the status of the ‚Äúgraceful exit‚Äù problem in superstring cosmology and present a possible resolution. It is shown that there exists a solution to this problem in two-dimensional dilaton gravity provided quantum corrections are incorporated. This is similar to the recently proposed solution of Rey. However, unlike in his case, in our oneloop corrected model the graceful exit problem is solved for any finite number of massless scalar matter fields present in the theory.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Building on evidence starting from 1966, X-ray observations have once again confirmed the association of quasars with low redshift galaxies. Enough examples of quasar-like objects ejected in opposite  directions from nearby, active galaxies have accumulated so that an empirical evolutionary sequence can be outlined.</p>
					<p>The quasars start out with low luminosity and high (ùëß  &gt; 2) redshift. As they travel away from their galaxy of origin they grow in size and decay in redshift. The redshifts drop in steps and near the quantized values of ùëß = 0.6, 0.3, and 0.06 the quasars become particularly active, ejecting or breaking up into many objects which evolve finally into groups and clusters of galaxies. The observations massively violate the assumptions of the Big Bang and require continuous, episodic creation in a non expanding universe of indefinitely large size and age.</p>

				<title>An Analysis of 900 Rotation Curves of Southern Sky Spiral Galaxies: Do Rotation Curves Fall into Discrete Classes?</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0407-0414</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>One of the largest rotation curve data bases of spiral galaxies currently available is that provided by Persic &amp; Salucci (1995; hereafter, PS) which has been derived by them from unreduced rotation curve data of 965 southern sky spirals obtained by Mathewson, Ford &amp; Buchhorn (1992; hereafter, MFB). Of the original sample of 965 galaxies, the observations on 900 were considered by PS to be good enough for rotation curve studies, and the present analysis concerns itself with these 900 rotation curves</p>
					<p>The analysis is performed within the context of the hypothesis that velocity fields within spiral discs can be described by generalized powerlaws. Rotation curve data was found to impose an extermely strong and detailed correlation between the free parameters of the power-law model, and this correlation accounts for virtually all the variation in the pivotal diagram. In the process, the analysis reveals completely unexpected structure which indicates that rotation curves can be partitioned into welldefined discrete subclasses.</p>

					<p>Evidence for redshift quantization is reviewed and summarlized. The cosmic background rest frame appears to be central to the effect. Periods are consistently found to be members of a set predicted by the ninth-root Lehto-Tifft rule which has implications relating to the possible nature of time, particle physics and cosmology. Galaxies can be divided into four morphological families associated with particular classes of periods. Numerous examples are given including recent work where redshifts appear to show evidence of changes between related quantized levels.</p>

					<p>The variable Mass Hypothesis of conformal gravitation theory of Hoyle-Narlikar is used to develop a model for the anomalous redshift quasar-galaxy associations. It is hypothesised that quasars are born in and ejected from the nuclei of parent galaxies as massless objects and the particle masses in them systematically increase with epoch. The dynamics of such an ejection is discussed and it is shown that the observed features such as redshift bunching and quasar alignments can be understood in this scenario. Further tests of this hypothesis are suggested.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The paper shows that a phenomenological model of inertial induction based on a proposed extension of Mach‚Äôs Principle can produce the observed cosmological red shift in a quasi-static infinite universe. Unlike all other theories (except the Doppler effect) to explain the observed red shift this model can be verified from other local effects predicted by this mechanism. A number of such phenomena have been investigated and these expected effects are not only found to be present but they also explain a number of unexplained or ill explained observational results. It is suggested that atttmpts should be made to verify the model through further tests and observations.</p>

				<title>Quantized Redshifts: A Status Report</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0455-0463</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The current status of a continuing programme of tests for redshift periodicity or `quantization' of nearby bright galaxies is described. So far the redshifts of over 250 galaxies with high-precision HI profiles have been used in the study. In consistently selected sub-samples of the datasets of sufficient precision examined so far, the redshift distribution has been found to be strongly quantized in the galactocentric frame of reference. The phenomenon is easily seen by eye and apparently cannot be ascribed to statistical artefacts, selection procedures or flawed reduction techniques. Two galactocentric periodicities have so far been detected, ~ 71¬∑5km s<sup>-1</sup> in the Virgo cluster, and ~37¬∑5km s<sup>-1</sup> for all other spiral galaxies within ~ 2600km s<sup>-1</sup>. The formal confidence levels associated with these results are extremely high.</p>

				<title>Individual and Integrated Pulse Properties of PSR B0943+10 Involved in the Mode-Changing Phenomenon</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0001-0018</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The characteristics of the ‚Äúburst‚Äù (B) mode and ‚Äúquiescent‚Äù (Q) mode pulse sequences‚Äîlong known from studies at or below 103 MHz‚Äîare identified at 430 MHz for the first time. An 18-minute, Polarimetrie observation begins with a long Bmode sequence, which has a higher average intensity, regular drifting subpulses, and a preponderance of primary polarisationmode radiation. An abrupt transition to a Q-mode sequence is then marked by a) weaker average intensity, but occasional very bright individual subpulses, b) a complete cessation of drifting subpulses, with disorganized subpulses now being emitted over a much wider longitude interval, and c) near parity between the primary and secondary polarisation modes, resulting in pronounced depolarisation, both of individual pulses and the average profile.</p>
					<p>Careful study, however, of profile changes before and after this mode change reveals slower variations which both anticipate the abrupt transition and respond to it. A slow attenuation of the intensity level of the dominant component is observed throughout the duration of the B-mode sequence, which then accelerates with the onset of the Q-mode sequence. This slow variation appears to represent a ‚Äúpreswitching transition‚Äù process; and the combination of effects on slow and abrupt time scales are finally responsible for the formation of the characteristic B and Q-mode average profiles.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We explore a simple model for the representation of the observed distributions of the motions, and the characteristic ages of the  local population of pulsars. The principal difference from earlier models is the introduction of a unique value, S, for the kick velocity with which pulsars are born. We consider separately the proper motion components in galactic longitude and latitude, and find that the distributions of the velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the galactic plane are represented satisfactorily by S = 200 km/sec, and leave no room for a significant fraction of much higher velocities. The successful proposition of a unique value for the kick velocity may provide an interesting tool in attempts to understand the physical process leading to the expulsion of the neutron star.</p>

				<title>A Low Frequency Radio Telescope at Mauritius for a Southern Sky Survey</title>

				<page>0035-0053</page>
				<abstract>
					<p> A new, meter-wave radio telescope has been built in the northeast of Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean, at a latitude of ‚Äì20.14¬∞. The Mauritius Radio Telescope (MRT) is a Fourier Synthesis T-shaped array, consisting of a 2048 m long East-West arm and an 880 m long South arm. In the East-West arm 1024 fixed helices are arranged in 32 groups and in the South arm 16 trolleys, with four helices on each, which move on a rail are used. A 512-channel digital complex correlation receiver is used to measure the visibility function. At least 60 days of observing are required for obtaining the visibilities up to 880 m spacing. The Fourier transform of the calibrated visibilities produces a map of the area of the sky under observation with a synthesized beam width 4' √ó 4.6' sec(Œ¥ + 20.14¬∞) at151.5 MHz</p>
					<p>The primary objective of the telescope is to produce a sky survey in the declination range ‚Äî70¬∞ to ‚Äî10¬∞ with a point source sensitivity of about 200 mJy (3 level). This will be the southern sky equivalent of the Cambridge 6C survey. In this paper we describe the telescope, discuss the array design and the calibration techniques used, and present a map made using the telescope.</p>

					<p>The observations of the black hole binary Cygnus X-1 were made in the energy band of 20-100keV with a balloon-borne Zenonfilled multiwire proportional counter telescope on 5th April 1992. Timing analysis of the data revealed the presence of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) in the hard X-ray emission from the source. The QPO feature in the power density spectrum is broad with a peak at a frequency of 0.06 Hz. This result is compared with similar reports of QPOs in Cyg X-l in soft and hard X-rays. Short time scale random intensity variations in the X-ray light curve are described with a shot noise model.</p>

				<title>The Redshift Dependence of Spectral Index in Powerful Radio Galaxies</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0063-0077</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present and discuss in this paper the rest frame radio spectra (1‚Äì25 GHz) of a sample of fourteen radio galaxies at z &gt; 2 from the newly defined MRC/1Jy complete sample of 558 radio sources. These galaxies are among the most powerful radio sources known and range in luminosity from 10<sup>28</sup>‚Äì10<sup>28.8</sup>  watt Hz<sup>-1</sup> at 1 GHz. We find that the median rest frame spectral index of this sample of galaxies at z &gt; 2 is significantly steeper than that of a matched luminosity sample of 3CRR galaxies which are at a much lower redshift (0.85 &lt; z &lt; 1.7). This indicates that spectral index correlates primarily with redshift, at least in the luminosity range considered here. The difference between the distributions of rest frame spectral curvatures for the two samples does not appear to be statistically significant</p>
					<p>We suggest a new explanation for the steeper spectra of radio galaxies at high redshift involving steeper electron energy spectra at injection. Electron energy spectra are expected to steepen in a first-order Fermi acceleration process, at both non-relativistic and relativistic shock fronts, as the upstream fluid velocity decreases. This may well be the case at high redshifts: the hotter and denser circum-galactic medium at high redshifts could result in slower speeds for the hotspot and the jet material behind it. The smaller sizes of radio sources at higher redshifts provide support to this scenario.</p>

				<title>Molecular Gas Associated with the IRAS-Vela Shell</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0079-0096</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We present a survey of molecular gas in the J = 1 ‚Üí 0 transition of <sup>12</sup>CO towards the IRAS Vela Shell. The shell, previously identified from IRAS maps, is a ring-like structure seen in the region of the Gum Nebula. We confirm the presence of molecular gas associated with some of the infrared point sources seen along the shell. We have studied the morphology and kinematics of the gas and conclude that the shell is expanding at the rate of ~ 13 km s<sup>-1</sup> from a common center. We go on to include in this study the Southern Dark Clouds seen in the region. The distribution and motion of these objects firmly identify them as being part of the shell of molecular gas. Estimates of the mass of gas involved in this expansion reveal that the shell is a massive object comparable to a GMC. From the expansion and various other signatures like the presence of bright-rimmed clouds with head-tail morphology, clumpy distribution of the gas etc., we conjecture that the molecular gas we have detected is the remnant of a GMC in the process of being disrupted and swept outwards through the influence of a central OB association, itself born of the parent cloud</p>

					<p>To summarize briefly, in most cases we found HI absorption at velocities corresponding to the optical absorption features provided one restricted oneself to velocities ‚â≤ 10 kms‚Äì1. At higher velocities we did not detect any HI absorption down to an optical depth limit of 0.1 (except in four cases which we attribute to gas in systematic motion rather than clouds in random motion). After discussing various scenarios, we suggest that this trend should perhaps be understood in terms of the high velocity interstellar clouds being accelerated, heated and ablated by expanding supernova remnants. </p>

				<title>Understanding the Spectral Energy Distributions of the Galactic Star Forming Regions IRAS 18314-0720, 18355-0532 and 18316-0602</title>

				<abstract>
					<p>Embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in dense interstellar clouds are treated self-consistently to understand their spectral energy distributions (SED). Radiative transfer calculations in spherical geometry involving the dust as well as the gas component, have been carried out to explain observations covering a wide spectral range encompassing nearinfrared to radio continuum wavelengths. Various geometric and physical details of the YSOs are determined from this modelling scheme.</p>
					<p>In order to assess the effectiveness of this self-consistent scheme, three young Galactic star forming regions associated with IRAS 18314-0720, 18355-0532 and 18316-0602 have been modelled as test cases. They cover a large range of luminosity (‚âà 40). The modelling of their SEDs has led to information about various details of these sources, e.g. embedded energy source, cloud structure and size, density distribution, composition and abundance of dust grains etc. In all three cases, the best fit model corresponds to the uniform density distribution. Two types of dust have been considered, viz., Draine &amp; Lee (DL) and the Mezger, Mathis &amp; Panagia (MMP). Models with MMP type dust explain the dust continuum and radio continuum emission from IRAS 18314-0720 and 18355-0532 self-consistently. These models predict much lower intensities for the fine structure lines of ionized heavy elements, than those observed for IRAS 18314-0720 and 18355-0532. This discrepancy has been resolved by invoking clumpiness in the interstellar medium. For IRAS 18316-0602, the model with DL type dust grains is preferred.</p>

				<title>Infrared Emission from Interstellar Dust Cloud with Two Embedded Sources: IRAS 19181 + 1349</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0023-0035</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Mid- and far-infrared maps of many Galactic star forming regions show multiple peaks in close proximity, implying more than one embedded energy source. With the aim of understanding such interstellar clouds better, the present study models the case of two embedded sources. A radiative transfer scheme has been developed to deal with a uniform density dust cloud in a cylindrical geometry, which includes isotropic scattering in addition to the emission and absorption processes. This scheme has been applied to the Galactic star forming region associated with IRAS 19181 + 1349, which shows observational evidence for two embedded energy sources. Two independent modelling approaches have been adopted, viz., to fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) best; or to fit the various radial profiles best, as a function of wavelength. Both the models imply remarkably similar physical parameters.</p>

				<title>Determination of Linear Polarization and Faraday Rotation of Pulsar Signals from Spectral Intensity Modulation </title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0037-0050</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Most of the known pulsars are sources of highly linearly polarized radiation. Faraday rotation in the intervening medium rotates the plane of the linear polarization as the signals propagate through the medium. The Rotation Measure (RM), which quantifies the amount of such rotation as a function of wavelength, is useful in studying the properties of the medium and in recovering the intrinsic polarization characteristics of the pulsar signal. Conventional methods for polarization measurements use telescopes equipped with dual orthogonally polarized feeds that allow estimation of all 4 Stokes parameters. Some telescopes (such as the Ooty Radio Telescope) that offer high sensitivity for pulsar observations may however be receptive to only a single linear polarization. In such a case, the apparent spectral intensity modulation, resulting from differential Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized signal component within the observing bandwidth, can be exploited to estimate the RM as well as to study the linear polarization properties of the source. In this paper, we present two improved procedures by which these observables can be estimated reliably from the intensity modulation over large bandwidths, particularly at low radio frequencies. We also highlight some other applications where such measurements and procedures would be useful.</p>

					<p>We present NeV/MgV and SiVII/MgVII theoretical line intensity ratios as a function of electron density ùëÅùëí and temperature ùëáùëí. These are shown in the form of ratio-ratio diagrams, which should in principle allow both ùëÅùëí and ùëáùëí to be deduced for the emitting region of the solar plasma. We apply these diagnostics in the solar atmosphere, and discuss the available observations made from space. In most cases, however, we deduce ùëÅùëí and ùëáùëí from the computed absolute line intensities in a spherically symmetric model atmosphere of the Sun. Possible future applications of the investigation to spectral data from the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) are briefly discussed.</p>

					<p>This contribution gives a personal view on recent attempts to find a unified framework for non-perturbative string theories, with special emphasis on the hidden symmetries of supergravity and their possible role in this endeavor. A reformulation of ùëë = 11  supergravity with enlarged tangent space symmetry SO(1, 2) √ó SO(16) is discussed from this perspacitive, as well as an ansatz to construct yet further versions with SO(1, 1) √ó SO(16)<sup>‚àû</sup> and possibly even SO(1, 1)<sub>+</sub> √ó ISO(16)<sup>‚àû</sup> tangent space symmetry. It is suggested that upon "third quantization", dimensionally reduced maximal supergravity may have an equally important role to play in this unification as the dimensionally reduced maximally supersymmetric SU(‚àû) Yang Mills theory.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Naturally occurring water vapor maser emission at 1.35 cm wavelength provides an accurate probe for the study of accretion disks around highly compact objects, thought to be black holes, in the centers of active galaxies. Because of the exceptionally fine angular resolution, 200 microarcseconds, obtainable with very long baseline interferometry, accompanied by high spectral resolution, &lt; 0.1 km s<sup>-1</sup>, the dynamics and structures of these disks can be probed with exceptional clarity. The data on the galaxy NGC 4258 are discussed here in detail. The mass of the black hole binding the accretion disk is 3¬∑9 √ó 10<sup>7</sup> Œú<sub>‚äô</sub>. Although the accretion disk has a rotational period of about 800 years, the physical motions of the masers have been directly measured with VLBI over a period of a few years. These measurements also allow the distance from the earth to the black hole to be estimated to an accuracy of 4 per cent. The status of the search for other maser/black hole candidates is also discussed</p>

				<title>The Massive Black Hole at the Galactic Center</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0187-0196</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>At the dynamic center of the Milky Way high spatial resolution, near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy have made it possible in the last few years to measure stellar velocities down to separations of less than five light days from the compact radio source SgrA* (in the constellation Sagittarius). These measurements make a compelling case for the presence of a compact, central dark mass of 2.6 √ó 10<sup>6</sup> solar masses. Simple physical considerations show that this dark mass cannot consist of a stable cluster of stars, stellar remnants, substellar condensations or a degenerate gas of elementary particles. Energy equipartition requires that at least 10<sup>5</sup> solar masses must be associated with SgrA* itself and is enclosed within less than 8 light minutes (equivalent to 15 Schwarzschild radii of a million solar mass black hole). If one accepts these arguments it is hard to escape the conclusions that there must be a massive black hole at the core of the Milky Way.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>I review the evidence for stellar mass black holes in the Galaxy. The unique properties of the soft X-ray transient (SXTs) have provided the first opportunity for detailed studies of the mass-losing star in low-mass X-ray binaries. The large mass functions of these systems imply that the compact object has a mass greater than the maximum mass of a neutron star, strengthening the case that they contain black holes. The results and techniques used are discussed. I also review the recent study of a comparison of the luminosities of black hole and neutron star systems which has yielded compelling evidence for the existence of event horizons.</p>

					<p> This article gives an elementary review of gravitational collapse and the cosmic censorship hypothesis. Known models of collapse resulting in the formation of black holes and naked singularities are summarized. These models, when taken together, suggest that the censorship hypothesis may not hold in classical general relativity. The nature of the quantum processes that take place near a naked singularity, and their possible implication for observations, is briefly discussed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>We have tried to determine the flux of the ultraviolet background radiation field from the column density ratios of various ions in several absorption systems observed in the spectra of QSOs. We find that in most cases the flux is considerably higher than what has been estimated to be contributed by the AGNs. The excess flux could originate locally in hot stars. In a few cases we have been able to show that such galactic flux can only contribute a part of the total required flux. The results suggest that the background gets a significant contribution from an unseen QSO population.</p>

				<page>0029-0038</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The outburst of X-ray transient source XTE J2012+381 was detected by the RXTE All-Sky Monitor on 1998 May 24th. Following the outburst, X-ray observations of the source were made in the 2-18keV energy band with the Pointed Proportional Counters of the Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment (IXAE) on-board the Indian satellite IRS-P3 during 1998 June 2nd-10th. The X-ray flux of the source in the main outburst decreased exponentially during the period of observation. No large amplitude short-term variability in the intensity is detected from the source. The power density spectrum obtained from the timing analysis of the data shows no indication of any quasi-periodic oscillations in 0.002- 0.5 Hz band. The hardness ratio i.e. the ratio of counts in 6-18 keV to 2-6 keV band, indicates that the X-ray spectrum is soft with spectral index >2. From the similarities of the X-ray properties with those of other black hole transients, we conclude that the X-ray transient XTE J2012+381 is likely to be a black hole</p>

				<title>A New Scheme of Radiation Transfer in HII Regions including Transient Heating of Grains</title>
				<feature></feature>
				<page>0061-0076</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>A new scheme of radiation transfer for understanding the infrared spectra of HII regions, has been developed. This scheme considers non-equilibrium processes (e.g. transient heating of the very small grains, VSG; and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAH) also, in addition to the equilibrium thermal emission from normal dust grains (BG). The spherically symmetric interstellar dust cloud is segmented into a large number of "onion skin" shells in order to implement the non-equilibrium processes. The scheme attempts to fit the observed SED originating from the dust component, by exploring the following parameters: (i) geometrical details of the dust cloud, (ii) PAH size and abundance, (iii) composition of normal grains (BG), (iv) radial distribution of all dust (BG, VSG &amp; PAH).</p>
					<p>The scheme has been applied to a set of five compact Œó II regions (IRAS 18116-1646, 18162-2048, 19442 + 2427, 22308 + 5812, and 18434 ‚Äî 0242) whose spectra are available with adequate spectral resolution. The best fit models and inferences about the parameters for these sources are presented.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>ISOGAL is a survey at 7 and 15 ¬µm with ISOCAM of the inner galactic disk and bulge of our Galaxy. The survey covers ~ 22 deg<sup>2</sup> in selected areas of the central l = ¬±30 degree of the inner Galaxy. In this paper, we report the study of a small ISOGAL field in the inner galactic bulge (l = 0¬∞,b = -1¬∞, area = 0.033deg<sup>2</sup>). Using the multicolor nearinfrared data (IJK<sub>s</sub>) of DENIS (DEep Near Infrared Southern Sky Survey) and mid-infrared ISOGAL data, we discuss the nature of the ISOGAL sources. The various color-color and color-magnitude diagrams are discussed in the paper. While most of the detected sources are red giants (RGB tip stars), a few of them show an excess in J-K<sub>s</sub> and K<sub>s</sub> -[15] colors with respect to the red giant sequence. Most of them are probably AGB stars with large mass-loss rates.</p>

				<page>0091-0099</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It has long been established that the ratio of total to selective extinction is anomalously large (‚â• 5) in certain regions of the interstellar medium. In these regions of anomalous extinction the dust grains are likely to be irregular in shape and fluffy in structure. Using discrete dipole approximation (DDA) we calculate the extinction for porous and fluffy grains. We apply DDA first to solid spheroidal particles assumed to be made of a certain (large) number of dipoles. Then we systematically reduce the number of dipoles to model the porous grains. The aggregates of these particles are suggested to form the fluffy grains. We study the extinction for these particles as a function of grain size, porosity and wavelength. We apply these calculations to interpret the observed extinction data in the regions of star formation (e.g. the Orion complex).</p>

				<page>0119-0125</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The tilt angles of sunspot groups are defined, using the Mount Wilson data set. It is shown that groups with tilt angles greater than or less than the average value (‚âà5 deg) show different latitude dependences. This effect is also seen in synoptic magnetic field data defining plages. The fraction of the total sunspot group area that is found in the leading spots is discussed as a parameter that can be useful in studying the dynamics of sunspot groups. This parameter is larger for low tilt angles, and small for extreme tilt angles in either direction. The daily variations of sunspot group tilt angles are discussed. The result that sunspot tilt angles tend to rotate toward the average value is reviewed. It is suggested that at some depth, perhaps 50 Mm, there is a flow relative to the surface that results from a rotation rate faster than the surface rate by about 60 m/sec and a meridional drift that is slower than the surface rate by about 5 m/sec. This results in a slanted relative flow at that depth that is in the direction of the average tilt angle and may be responsible for the tendency for sunspot groups (and plages) to rotate their magnetic axes in the direction of the average tilt angle.</p>

				<title>New High Resolution Observations of the Solar Diameter from Space and Ground with the Microsatellite Program PICARD</title>
				<feature>Session II ‚Äì Synoptic Observations</feature>
				<page>0135-0140</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The PICARD microsatellite mission will provide 2 to 6 years simultaneous measurements of the solar diameter, differential rotation and solar constant to investigate the nature of their relations and variabilities. The 100 kg satellite has a 40 kg payload consisting of 3 instruments which will provide an absolute measure (better than 10 milliarcsec) of the diameter and the solar shape, a measure of total solar irradiance, and UV and visible flux in selected wavelength bands. Now in Phase B, PICARD is expected to be launched before mid-2003. The engineering model of the diameter telescope will be used on ground simultaneously with the satellite to investigate the atmospheric bias and state on the possible accuracy of the ground measurements carried up to now. We review the scientific goals linked to the diameter measurement, present the payload, and give a brief overview of the program aspects.</p>

				<title>Results from Kodaikanal Synoptic Observations</title>
				<feature>Session II ‚Äì Synoptic Observations</feature>
				<page>0149-0153</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The synoptic observations of Kodaikanal form one of the longest unbroken solar data from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day, and consists of the white light and monochromatic images of the sun. In this review, I shall discuss the results of the investigations in two areas using these data: (i) Tilt angles of the magnetic axes of bipolar spot groups, and (ii) structure and dynamics of large scale unipolar magnetic regions on the solar surface.</p>
					<p>The observed properties and patterns of behaviour of the tilt angles can be used as effective diagnostics to infer the physical conditions in the subsurface layers of the sun, and thus get an insight into the physical effects that act on the rising magnetic flux tubes during their journey through the convection zone to the surface.</p>
					<p>The second topic of discussion here, namely, the studies of the dynamics of unipolar regions over several solar cycles, show that the global solar activity has a high latitude component which manifests in the form of polar faculae, in addition to the well known sunspot activity at the middle and low latitudes. This raises the question about the origin of this high latitude component.</p>

				<title>22-Year Periodicity in the Solar Differential Rotation</title>
				<feature>Session III ‚Äì Sunspots &amp; Solar Cycle</feature>
				<page>0167-0170</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using the data on sunspot groups compiled during 1879-1975, we determined variations in the differential rotation coefficients ùê¥ and ùêµ during the solar cycle. The variation in the equatorial rotation rate ùê¥ is found to be significant only in the odd numbered cycles, with an amplitude ~ 0.01 ¬µ rads<sup>-1</sup>. There exists a good anticorrelation between the variations of the differential rotation rate ùêµ derived from the odd and even numbered cycles, suggesting existence of a '22-year' periodicity in ùêµ. The amplitude of the variation of ùêµ is ~ 0.05 ¬µ rad s<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

				<feature>Session III ‚Äì Sunspots &amp; Solar Cycle</feature>
				<page>0173-0176</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We report here a study of various solar activity phenomena occurring in both north and south hemispheres of the Sun during solar cycles 8-23. In the study we have used sunspot data for the period 1832‚Äî1976, flare index data for the period 1936-1993, HŒ± flare data 1993-1998 and solar active prominences data for the period 1957-1998. Earlier Verma reported long-term cyclic period in N-S asymmetry and also that the N-S asymmetry of solar activity phenomena during solar cycles 21, 22, 23 and 24 will be south dominated and the N-S asymmetry will shiftto north hemisphere in solar cycle 25. The present study shows that the N-S asymmetry during solar cycles 22 and 23 are southern dominated as suggested by Verma.</p>

				<title>Solar Filaments as Tracers of Subsurface Processes</title>
				<feature>Session IV ‚Äì Filaments &amp; Coronal Structures</feature>
				<page>0177-0183</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Solar filaments are discussed in terms of two contrasting paradigms. The standard paradigm is that filaments are formed by condensation of coronal plasma into magnetic fields that are twisted or dimpled as a consequence of motions of the fields' sources in the photosphere. According to a new paradigm, filaments form in rising, twisted flux ropes and are a necessary intermediate stage in the transfer to interplanetary space of dynamo-generated magnetic flux. It is argued that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in filaments and their coronal sur-roundings leads to filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections. These ejections relieve the Sun of the flux generated by the dynamo and make way for the flux of the next cycle.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The solar corona-one of the most spectacular celestial shows and yet one of the most challenging puzzles-exhibits a spectrum of structures related to both the quiet Sun and active regions. In spite of dramatic differences in appearance and physical processes, all these structures share a common origin: they are all related to the solar magnetic field. The origin of the field is beneath the turbulent convection zone, where the magnetic field is not a master but a slave, and one can wonder how much the coronal magnetic field "remembers" its dynamo origin. Surprisingly, it does. We will describe several observational phenomena that indicate a close relationship between coronal and sub-photospheric processes.</p>

					<p>Long-term cycle variations in the distribution of prominences and intensities of green (530.3 nm) and red (637.4 nm) coronal emission lines over solar cycles 18-23 are presented. Polar prominence branches will reach the poles at different epochs in cycle 23: the north branch at the beginning in 2002 and the south branch a year later (2003), respectively. The local maxima of intensities in the green line show both poleward- and equatorward-migrating branches. The poleward branches will reach the poles around' cycle maxima like prominences, while the equatorward branches show a duration of 18 years and will end in cycle minima (2007). The red corona shows mostly equatorward branches. The possibility that these branches begin to develop at high latitudes in the preceding cycles cannot be excluded.</p>

					<p>Precise measurements of heliographic position of solar filaments were used for determination of the proper motion of solar filaments on the time-scale of days. The filaments have a tendency to make a shaking or waving of the external structure and to make a general movement of whole filament body, coinciding with the transport of the magnetic flux in the photosphere. The velocity scatter of individual measured points is about one order higher than the accuracy of measurements.</p>

				<page>0213-0220</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Observations of the strength and spatial distribution of vector magnetic fields in active regions have revealed several fundamental properties of the twist of their magnetic fields. First, the handedness of this twist obeys a hemispheric rule: left-handed in the northern hemisphere, right-handed in the southern. Second, the rule is weak; active regions often disobey it. It is statistically valid only in a large ensemble. Third, the rule itself, and the amplitude of the scatter about the rule, are quantitatively consistent with twisting of fields by turbulence as flux tubes buoy up through the convection zone. Fourth, there is considerable spatial variation of twist within active regions. However, relaxation to a linear force-free state, which has been documented amply in laboratory plasmas, is not observed.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>Solar flares, prominences and CMEs are well known manifestations of solar activity. For many years, qualitative studies were made about the cyclical behaviour of such phenomena. Nowadays, more quantitative studies have been undertaken with the aim to understand the solar cycle dependence of such phenomena as well as peculiar behaviour, such as asymmetries and periodicities, occurring within the solar cycle. Here, we plan to review the more recent research concerning all these topics.</p>

				<feature>Session V ‚Äì Vector Magnetic Fields, Prominences, CMEs &amp; Flares</feature>
				<page>0233-0236</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The active region NoAA 8032 of April 15, 1997 was observed to evolve rapidly. The GOES X-ray data showed a number of sub-flares and two C-class flares during the 8-9 hours of its evolution. The magnetic evolution of this region is studied to ascertain its role in flare production. Large changes were observed in magnetic field configuration due to the emergence of new magnetic flux regions (EFR). Most of the new emergence occured very close to the existing magnetic regions, which resulted in strong magnetic field gradients in this region. EFR driven reconnection of the field lines and subsequent flux cancellation might be the reason for the continuous occurrence of sub-flares and other related activities.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>A set of 21 solar type II radio bursts observed using Hiraiso radio spectrograph have been analysed to study the direction of propagation of coronal shocks. Œë simple analysis is carried out to find the approximate angle between the shock normal and magnetic field by solving the Rankine-Hugoniot MHD relation with assumption of Alfven speed and plasma beta. From this analysis, it is suggested that both quasi-parallel shocks (favourable) and quasi-perpendicular shocks can generate type II bursts depending upon the circumstances of the corona.</p>

					<p>A gradient based algorithm which divides arbitrary images into non-overlapping surface filling tiles of opposite polarity is used to study the flux and size distributions of large scale magnetic flux concentrations in solar and heliospheric observatory (SoHO) magnetograms. The mean absolute flux and size of the concentrations at the considered scale is found to be about 1.7 √ó 10<sup>18</sup>Mx and 5.2Mm for both polarities. The form of the flux distribution is characterized by a skewness of Œ±<sub>3</sub> = 4.9 and a kurtosis of Œ±<sub>4</sub>, = 42.8. The fall in the distribution in the range 6.5 √ó 10<sup>17</sup>Mx to 5 √ó 10<sup>18</sup>Mx is described by an exponential fit, in agreement with a model for the sustenance of quiet region flux.</p>

					<p>At the solar surface the magnetic field is bundled into discrete elements of concentrated flux, often referred to as magnetic flux tubes, which cover only a small fraction of the solar surface. Flux tubes span a whole spectrum of sizes, ranging from sunspots to features well below the best currently obtainable spatial resolution.</p>
					<p>Whereas sunspots have been well studied, our knowledge of the true brightness of small-scale magnetic features is hampered by the insufficient spatial resolution of the observations.

				<abstract>
					<p>We model the dynamical interaction between magnetic flux tubes and granules in the solar photosphere which leads to the excitation of transverse (kink) and longitudinal (sausage) tube waves. The investigation is motivated by the interpretation of network oscillations in terms of flux tube waves. The calculations show that for magnetic field strengths typical of the network, the energy flux in transverse waves is higher than in longitudinal waves by an order of magnitude. But for weaker fields, such as those that might be found in internetwork regions, the energy fluxes in the two modes are comparable. Using observations of footpoint motions, the energy flux in transverse waves is calculated and the implications for chromospheric heating are pointed out.</p>

					<p>Simultaneous time series of broad-band images of two active regions close to the disk center were acquired at the maximum (0.80 ¬µm) and minimum (1.55 ¬µm) continuum opacities. Dark faculae are detected in images obtained as weighted intensity differences between both wavelength bands. The elements of quiet regions can be clearly distinguished from those of faculae and pores in scatter plots of brightness temperatures. There is a smooth transition between faculae and pores in the scatter plots. These facts are interpreted in terms of the balance between the inhibition of convective energy transport and the lateral radiative heating.</p>

					<p>To identify and understand the underlying physical mechanisms of total solar and UV irradiance variability and to estimate the contribution of various chromospheric features to UV irradiance, detailed analysis of spatially resolved data is required. The various chromospheric features have been segregated and different parameters have been derived from CaII Œö Spectroheliograms of NSO/Sac Peak and Kodaikanal Observatory and compared with UV irradiance flux measured in MgII h and k lines by NOAA 9 satellite.

				<title>The Hemispheric Sign Rule of Current Helicity during the Rising Phase of Cycle 23</title>
				<feature>Session VI ‚Äì Flux Tubes &amp; Irradiance Variability</feature>
				<page>0303-0306</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We compute the signs of two different current helicity parameters (i.e., <sup>ùõº</sup> best and ùêª<sub>ùëê</sub>) for 87 active regions during the rise of cycle 23. The results indicate that 59% of the active regions in the northern hemisphere have negative <sup>ùõº</sup>best and 65% in the southern hemisphere have positive. This is consistent with that of the cycle 22. However, the helicity parameter ùêª<sub>ùëê</sub> shows a weaker opposite hemispheric preference in the new solar cycle. Possible reasons are discussed.</p>

					<p>We review current understanding of the interaction of magnetic fields with convective motions in stellar convection zones.

				<abstract>
					<p>Horizontal large-scale velocity field describes horizontal displacement of the photospheric magnetic flux in zonal and meridian directions. The flow systems of solar plasma, constructed according to the velocity field, create the large-scale cellular-like patterns with up-flow in the center and the down-flow on the boundaries. Distribution of the largescale horizontal eddies (with characteristic scale length from 350 to 490 Mm) was found in the broad equatorial zone, limited by 60¬∞ latitude circles on both hemispheres. The zonal averages of the zonal and meridian velocities, and the total horizontal velocity for each Carrington rotation during the activity cycles no. 21 and 22 varies during the 11-yr activity cycle. Plot of RMS values of total horizontal velocity is shifted about 1¬∑6 years before the similarly shaped variation of the magnetic flux.</p>

				<feature>Session VIII ‚Äì Helioseismology</feature>
				<page>0323-0329</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The inversion of helioseismic modes leads to the sound velocity inside the Sun with a precision of about 0.1 per cent. Comparisons of solar models with the "seismic sun" represent powerful tools to test the physics: depth of the convection zone, equation of state, opacities, element diffusion processes and mixing inside the radiative zone. We now have evidence that microscopic diffusion (element segregation) does occur below the convection zone, leading to a mild helium depletion in the solar outer layers. Meanwhile this process must be slowed down by some macroscopic effect, presumably rotation-induced mixing. The same mixing is also responsible for the observed lithium depletion. on the other hand, the observations of beryllium and helium 3 impose specific con straints on the depth of this mildly mixed zone. Helioseismology also gives information on the internal solar rotation: while differential rotation exists in the convection zone, solid rotation prevails in the radiative zone, and the transition layer (the so-called "tachocline") is very small. These effects are discussed, together with the astrophysical constraints on the solar neutrino fluxes.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>The interior of the Sun is not directly accessible to observations. Nonetheless, it is possible to infer the physical conditions inside the Sun with the help of structure equations governing its equilibrium and with the powerful observational tools provided by the neutrino fluxes and oscillation frequencies. The helioseismic data show that the internal constitution of the Sun can be adequately represented by a standard solar model. It turns out that a cooler solar core is not a viable solution for the measured deficit of neutrino fluxes, and the resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle should be sought in the realm of particle physics.</p>

				<feature>Session VIII ‚Äì Helioseismology</feature>
				<page>0361-0364</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>It is well known from Helioseismology that the Sun exhibits oscillations on a global scale, most of which are non-radial in nature. These oscillations help us to get a clear picture of the internal structure of the Sun as has been demonstrated by the theoretical and observational (such as GONG) studies. In this study we formulate the linearised equations of motion for non-radial oscillations by perturbing the MHD equilibrium solution for an axisymmetric incompressible fluid. The fluid motion and the magnetic field are expressed as scalars ùëà, ùëâ, ùëÉ and ùëá, respectively. In deriving the exact solution for the equilibrium state, we neglect the contribution due to meridional circulation. The perturbed quantities ùëà*, ùëâ*, ùëÉ*, ùëá* are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials. A special case of the above formulation and its stability is discussed.</p>

				<title>Mechanism of Cyclically Polarity Reversing Solar Magnetic Cycle as a Cosmic Dynamo</title>
				<feature>Session IX ‚Äì Dynamo Mechanisms</feature>
				<page>0365-0371</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>We briefly describe historical development of the concept of solar dynamo mechanism that generates electric current and magnetic field by plasma flows inside the solar convection zone. The dynamo is the driver of the cyclically polarity reversing solar magnetic cycle. The reversal process can easily and visually be understood in terms of magnetic field line stretching and twisting and folding in three-dimensional space by plasma flows of differential rotation and global convection under influence of Coriolis force. This process gives rise to formation of a series of huge magnetic flux tubes that propagate along iso-rotation surfaces inside the convection zone. Each of these flux tubes produces one solar cycle. We discuss general characteristics of any plasma flows that can generate magnetic field and reverse the polarity of the magnetic field in a rotating body in the Universe. We also mention a list of problems which are currently being disputed concerning the solar dynamo mechanism together with observational evidences that are to be constraints as well as verifications of any solar cycle dynamo theories of short and long term behaviors of the Sun, particularly time variations of its magnetic field, plasma flows, and luminosity.</p>

					<p>This review provides a historical overview of how research in kinematic solar dynamo modeling evolved during the last few decades and assesses the present state of research. The early pioneering papers assumed the dynamo to operate in the convection zone. It was suggested in the 1980s that the dynamo operates in a thin layer at the bottom of the convection zone. Some researchers in recent years are arguing that the poloidal field is produced near the surface‚Äîan idea that goes back to Babcock (1961) and Leighton (1969).</p>

				<page>0407-0411</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>Using spectra obtained from the SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation) spectrograph on the spacecraft SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory), we investigate the height dependence of electron density, temperature and abundance anomalies in the solar atmosphere. In particular, we present the behaviour of the solar FIP effect (the abundance enhancement of elements with first ionization potential &lt; 10 eV in the corona with respect to photospheric values) with height above an active region observed at the solar limb, with emphasis on the so-called transition region lines.</p>

				<title>Solar Wind Variation with the Cycle</title>
				<feature>Session XI ‚Äì Solar Wind &amp; Interplanetary Magnetic Fields</feature>
				<page>0423-0429</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The cyclic evolution of the heliospheric plasma parameters is related to the time-dependent boundary conditions in the solar corona. "Minimal" coronal configurations correspond to the regular appearance of the tenuous, but hot and fast plasma streams from the large polar coronal holes. The denser, but cooler and slower solar wind is adjacent to coronal streamers. Irregular dynamic manifestations are present in the corona and the solar wind everywhere and always. They follow the solar activity cycle rather well. Because of this, the direct and indirect solar wind measurements demonstrate clear variations in space and time according to the minimal, intermediate and maximal conditions of the cycles. The average solar wind density, velocity and temperature measured at the Earth's orbit show specific decadal variations and trends, which are of the order of the first tens per cent during the last three solar cycles. Statistical, spectral and correlation characteristics of the solar wind are reviewed with the emphasis on the cycles.</p>

				<title>Heliospheric Magnetic Fields, Energetic Particles, and the Solar Cycle</title>
				<feature>Session XI ‚Äì Solar Wind &amp; Interplanetary Magnetic Fields</feature>
				<page>0431-0437</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The heliosphere is the region filled with magnetized plasma of mainly solar origin. It extends from the solar corona to well beyond the planets, and is separated from the interstellar medium by the heliopause. The latter is embedded in a complex and still unexplored boundary region. The characteristics of heliospheric plasma, fields, and energetic particles depend on highly variable internal boundary conditions, and also on quasi-stationary external ones. Both galactic cosmic rays and energetic particles of solar and heliospheric origin are subject to intensity variations over individual solar cycles and also from cycle to cycle. Particle propagation is controlled by spatially and temporally varying interplanetary magnetic fields, frozen into the solar wind. An overview is presented of the main heliospheric components and processes, and also of the relevant missions and data sets. Particular attention is given to flux variations over the last few solar cycles, and to extrapolated effects on the terrestrial environment.</p>

				<title>Remote Sensing of the Heliospheric Solar Wind using Radio Astronomy Methods and Numerical Simulations</title>
				<feature>Session XI ‚Äì Solar Wind &amp; Interplanetary Magnetic Fields</feature>
				<page>0439-0444</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The ground-based radio astronomy method of interplanetary scintillations (IPS) and spacecraft observations have shown, in the past 25 years, that while coronal holes give rise to stable, recurring high speed solar wind steram during the minimum of the solar activity cycle, the slow speed wind seen more during the solar maximum activity is better associated with the closed field regions, which also give rise to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME's). The latter events increase significantly, as the cycle maximum takes place. We have recently shown that in the case of energetic flares one may be able to track the associated disturbances almost on a one to one basis from a distance of 0.2 to 1 AU using IPS methods. Time dependent 3D MHD models which are constrained by IPS observations are being developed. These models are able to simulate general features of the solar-generated disturbances. Advances in this direction may lead to prediction of heliospheric propagation of these disturbances throughout the solar system.</p>

				<feature>Session XI ‚Äì Solar Wind &amp; Interplanetary Magnetic Fields</feature>
				<page>0447-0450</page>
				<abstract>
					<p>The Ulysses Unified Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment (URAP) has observed Langmuir, ion-acoustic and associated solar type III radio emissions in the interplanetary medium. Bursts of 50-300 Hz (in the spacecraft frame) electric field signals, corresponding to long-wavelength ion-acoustic waves are often observed coincident in time with the most intense Langmuir wave spikes, providing evidence for the electrostatic decay instability. Langmuir waves often occur as envelope solitons, suggesting that strong turbulence processes, such as modulational instability and soliton formation, often coexist with weak turbulence processes, such as electrostatic decay, in a few type III burst source regions.</p>

				<abstract>
					<p>This summary lecture makes no attempt to summarize what was actually said at the meeting, since this is well covered by the other contributors. Instead I have structured my presentation in three parts: First I try to demonstrate why the Sun is unique by comparing it with laboratory plasmas. This is followed by some personal reminiscences that go back a significant fraction of the century. I conclude in the form of a poem about this memorable conference in honor of the centennial anniversary of the Kodaikanal Observatory.</p>
